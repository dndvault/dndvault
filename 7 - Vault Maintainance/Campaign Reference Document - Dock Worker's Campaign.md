# The Dock Workers' Campaign

- **Description**: Unrest plagues the ports of Waterdeep as angry workers clash with the police, demanding better hours, higher wages, and protection from dangerous materials. The conflict began with the death of a young woman due to toxic rune paint, a substance used in waypoint sigils, an incident the city is attempting to conceal. A brutal police crackdown has left the city simmering with resentment and fear. The adventuring party becomes involved after a major explosion blankets the streets in glowing blue liquid.
    
- **Date and Time**: The campaign starts on the 1st Day of Mirtul, 1580 DR, within the Age of Arcane Industry.
    
- **Homebrew Rulesets**:
    
    - Spellcasters can cast spells even when spell slots are depleted, taking a level of exhaustion corresponding to the spell slot level.
        
    - Characters with limited, powerful non-spellcasting abilities can use one expended ability again. Exhaustion is determined by a Constitution saving throw: critical success (no exhaustion), success (one level), failure (two levels), critical failure (three levels).
        
    - Waypoint mechanics: A magical transportation network using sigils and rune paint, with associated dangers and requirements (specific mechanics to be detailed in notes).
        
    - Combat Crowd Management: Features group initiative, collective HP/stats, and casualty tracking for large groups (specific mechanics in notes).
        
    - Non-Combat Crowd Management: Tracks crowd mood, reaction, and environmental impact (specific mechanics in notes).
        
    - Factional Reputation: Tracks party standing (Admired, Neutral, Hated, etc.) with key factions (Dock Workers, City Watch, Guilds, etc.) (specific mechanics in notes).
        
    - Terrain/Environment Familiarity: Grants Advantage/Disadvantage on relevant checks (physical or social) based on character background/experience in specific locations/environments, replacing inherent racial terrain traits (specific mechanics in notes).
        
    - Background/Class Status: Influences initial NPC disposition and social interaction checks based on perceived social standing (specific mechanics in notes). A character's species does not significantly influence stats.
        
    - Travel Network System: Structured tracking of routes between wards/landmarks, listing direction, time, distance, travel means, and status (specific mechanics in notes).

# The Job Offer

- **Description**: The scene takes place in a Watch barracks office, where a general is meeting with the crime scene crew. There is a problem: no one wants to clean up the Rune Ink Workshop, and the Arcane Division has refused to cooperate. They agree to hire a third party, seeking magically inclined or capable fighters willing to enter the building. During the meeting, a Watcher bursts in to report a containment breach: a headless skeleton is roaming the streets.
    
- **Duration**: 1 (unit not specified)
    
- **Scene Action**: The headless skeleton appears near the City of the Dead, where the body was buried.
    
    - **Multiple spawn point options**:
        
        - **Waterdeep Way**: A busy thoroughfare south of the City of the Dead, leading to Castle Ward (east) or Sea Ward (west). A creature fleeing the park could cause panic here.
            
        - **The High Road**: West of the City of the Dead, this significant street runs north-south, providing a direct route out of the city towards Neverwinter or south towards Castle Ward.
            
        - **Residences and Estates**: In the North Ward, bordering the City of the Dead, are noble estates. The skeleton could breach a garden wall or gate.
            
        - **Taverns/Inns**: If taverns or inns are adjacent to the park or on Waterdeep Way/High Road, the skeleton could stumble in, surprising patrons.
            
        - **Less-Traveled Alleys**: Smaller alleys or service ways between estates or along the park's edge offer evasion routes.
            
    - When the skeleton appears, the crowd panics and scatters.
        
- **Crowd Behavior**: Other (specified in description).
    
- **Sensory Imprint**: Not specified.
    
- **Story Circle Stage**: Go.

# Ciggy the Bard

- **Description**: Ciggy is a rugged Bard and a Union member. He is a strategist and the moral backbone of the group, with stories and songs that keep everyone motivated. He has dark, wild hair, tan olive skin, and a muscular build with a belly. He is human, around 50 years old, a chain-smoker, drinks heavily (but never seems drunk), and always has his lute ready. His skin is weathered, and his fingernails are dark purple from a lifetime of handling metal and chemicals.
    
- **Occupation**: Dock worker, union leader, bard, and Alga's husband.
    
- **Arc**: 1
    
- **Need**: A goddamn break.

- **Strengths**: 7089213
    
- **Weaknesses**: 2113825
    
- **Beliefs**: "Magic ain't real, everything's science." This is a deep-seated mistrust and denialism, viewing magic as a narrative used by elites to distract from real problems like industrial pollution, poor working conditions, and political corruption. He rationalizes magical effects as mundane issues or unknown biology. He is wary of overt spellcasters and believes suffering and death are caused by tangible factors rather than magic. He has never encountered inexplicable magic, which could challenge this belief.
    
- **Behavior**: Constantly smoking and playing his lute. Very social, seems to know everyone. Charismatic and humorous, but serious when necessary. Holds disdain for the bourgeois, believing "The rich folks upstream are all cunts and bootlickers. No rich man has ever cared for us harbordwellers."

        - **Terrain Advantage (The Docks)**: Advantage on ability checks related to navigating, finding things, or social interaction specifically within the Docks environment. Disadvantage on similar checks in entirely unfamiliar environments.
            
- **Actions**:
    
    - **Club**: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

- **Pronoun**: He.
    
- **Additional Information**: "Ciggy" or "Cig" is a nickname from his habit of asking for a smoke, which he uses to connect with people, though he pretends it's due to lack of coin. His real name is unknown.
    
- **Loot**: A well-maintained lute, enough coin for several packs of cigarettes, a club, a wedding ring, and simple worker's clothes.

- **Stake**: 6

- **Occupation**: Bartender, businesswoman, Union organizer, and Cig's wife.
    
- **Arc**: 1
    
- **Ghost**: Alga is the child of refugees; her mother was an Orc fleeing war, and her father was a Baldurian escaping gang violence. She was raised hearing stories of their trauma, making the world outside Waterdeep seem scary. Her first child, Toris, died in a factory accident, and she has been changed ever since. She named The Bugbear after her mother's stories, having never seen a Bugbear herself.
    
- **Lie**: "Baldurs Gate is only criminals and gangs, and you should never go there."
    
- **Need**: A push to leave her comfort zone.
    
- **Want**: A babysitter.
    
- **Opposition**: Financial issues.
    
- **Strengths**: 4456280
    
- **Weaknesses**: 2837148
    
- **Beliefs**: "This is all there is." Alga has never left Waterdeep and only knows the wider world through stories and newspapers. She believes adventures are for others, and her place is in Waterdeep, hoping her children will have a better life.
    
- **Behavior**: A hard-working woman who manages both the bar and the Union's finances. She appears in control but is a nervous, constantly worrying mother with a limited worldview. She can read and do math, taught by a kind neighbor, but never attended school. She is fidgety and always needs something to do. She speaks Orcish with her family, but a native speaker would notice it's not contemporary Orcish due to her limited exposure. She has hired cooks and servers for the pub.
    
- **Stats**:
    
    - **Ability Scores**:
        
        - Strength: 12 (+1)
            
        - Dexterity: 10 (+0)
            
        - Constitution: 14 (+2)
            
        - Intelligence: 15 (+2)
            
        - Wisdom: 12 (+1)
            
        - Charisma: 13 (+1)
            
    - **Hit Points**: 11 (2d8 + 2)
        
    - **Armor Class**: 10
        
    - **Saving Throws**: STR +1, DEX +0, CON +2, INT +2, WIS +1, CHA +1
        
    - **Skills**: Investigation +4, Insight +3, Persuasion +3
        
    - **Languages**: Common, Orcish.
        
    - **Traits**:
        
        - **Nervous Fidgeting**: Alga needs to be constantly doing something; she becomes anxious if idle for more than a few minutes.
            
        - **Always Children Underfoot**: Her children are frequently present and assist with chores, serving as either a distraction (DC 10 Perception) or assistance (+2 to group tasks).
            
- **Family Members**:
    
    - **Cig**: Her human husband and soulmate. They founded the Dockworker's Union together after their first son, Toris, died in a factory accident at age 16.
        
    - **Mergild**: Oldest child (after Toris' death), in puberty. Alga struggles to connect with her timid daughter but tries to understand her interests. Mergild loves studying, arcana, and languages, avoids eye contact, speaks Orcish and Common fluently, and learned runescript for work.
        
    - **Grub**: Named after Alga's Orcish grandfather, he is the most Orcish-looking child. At fourteen, with tusks grown in, he is the bouncer of The Bugbear's Pub and looks older than his age. He speaks Common and some Orcish, dislikes reading, but occasionally helps with accounting.
        
    - **Keg**: Eleven years old, suspiciously human-looking until he smiles. A notorious ankle-biter. He and Grub often "guard" the pub entrance by pestering Union members for the password. He usually speaks Common and likely has a learning disability, as he has not learned to read or write despite his parents' efforts.
        
    - **Ceril**: Eight years old, loves critters and insects, and is eager to show off new finds. He looks human but speaks fluent Orcish and strongly identifies with that heritage. He cries easily and has a strong sense of justice.
        
    - **Ogni**: The youngest, two years old, constantly carried by Alga, and can sleep through anything in The Bugbear.
        
    - **Sami**: Not related by blood, but Alga adopted Sami for the two years their paths intersected.
        
- **Pronoun**: She.

# The Rune Ink Scandal

- **Core Concept**: A scandal involving toxic rune ink used in dockyards leads to widespread magical poisoning among workers. This causes physical decay, transformation into Rune-Marked Skeletons, and spontaneous, chaotic Rune Ink Sorcery. The narrative explores industrial negligence, corruption, and the victims' resistance.
    
- **The Affliction (Rune Ink Poisoning)**:
    
    - **Mechanism**: Exposure to unstable rune ink causes magical poisoning, leading to decay.
        
    - **Transformation**: Advanced decay results in transformation into Rune-Marked Skeletons, where the victim's soul is trapped within the corrupted glowing bones.
        
    - **Rune-Marked Skeletons**:
        
        - **Not Undead**: They are not standard Undead creatures; spells like Turn Undead may not work, and Detect Evil and Good may register them differently. They are the original creature, transformed and trapped.
            
        - **Decay States**: They exist in various states, from partially fleshed to bare bone.
            
        - **Toxic Flesh**: Their sloughing flesh is highly toxic on contact and can create hazardous environmental patches, requiring Constitution saves.
            
        - **Moral Complexity**: Destroying them may or may not release the trapped soul.
            
    - **Rune Ink Sorcery / Surge**:
        
        - **Spontaneous Power**: Rare instances of the ink surging within a victim can grant chaotic magical abilities, similar to sorcery.
            
        - **Accelerated Decay**: Gaining these powers accelerates the rate of decay and transformation into a Rune-Marked Skeleton.
            
        - **Desperate Protest**: Afflicted individuals may use these powers in violent protests, including self-immolation for area effect damage or hazard.
            
- **The Resistance (Affected People)**:
    
    - The affected people are not passive victims; they actively fight for their rights and to expose the scandal.
        
    - **Methods of Resistance**: Organized protests (prone to crowd control), underground networks, sabotage, vigilante justice, and information warfare.
        
    - **Violence**: They may resort to violence if other means fail, sometimes weaponizing their affliction (Rune Ink Sorcery).
        
- **The Oppression (The Watch and Authorities)**:
    
    - **The Watch**: City police force, equipped with "Spellthieves" to counter threats, including magically-empowered victims and protesters.
        
    - **Spellthieves**:
        
        - Remote spellcasting devices used by officers.
            
        - Possess limited charges/spell slots.
            
        - Vulnerable to lightning damage.
            
        - Dependent on magical communication (sending stones) with remote wizards. Disrupting communication disables the device.
            
    - **Remote Wizards**:
        
        - Highly-trained wizards from prestigious academies.
            
        - Perform routine, desk-based tasks of casting spells remotely for the Watch.
            
        - Susceptible to persuasion for a potential strike, which would disable spellthieves city-wide.
            
    - **Spellcasting Documentation**:
        
        - Wizards must file reports for every spell cast via a spellthief.
            
        - These records contain valuable information (spell, officer, reason, time, location) that can be used as evidence to expose abuse of power or solve related crimes. Accessing these records is an investigation/stealth/social challenge.

# The Arcane Division's Quarters

- **Description**: The Arcane Division is a branch of the Watch dedicated to magical affairs. It is situated in the Castle Ward and facilitates communication between patrolmen and spellcasters. Its responsibilities include monitoring Spellthieves, surveilling Waypoints, and maintaining records related to spellcasting.

- **Entryways**:
    
    - **Main Entrance (Barracks Row)**: Primary entrance, likely stout, well-guarded, with mundane and potentially magical locks, and manned by Watch officers. Expected point of access for official visitors.
        
    - **Service Entrance/Rear Door**: Less prominent, perhaps in an alley or less public-facing side. Used for deliveries, staff, or prisoner transport. May be less overtly guarded but still requires authorization or bypassing secure locks.
        
    - **Basement Access/Maintenance Tunnel**: Discreet entrance to sub-levels. Could be disguised as utility access, sewer connection, or tunnel to other Watch buildings. Likely highly secure and possibly trapped.
        
    - **Magical Waypoint/Teleportation Circle**: Highly probable given the division's focus. Heavily keyed and protected, likely only accessible via authorized magic or specific items. Might lead directly to a secure receiving area.
        
- **Arcane Access Points**: Military Waypoint
    
- **Crowd Behavior**: There's work to do, but time to have a chat.
    
- **Rune Ink Contamination**: None

# Sending Stone

- **Description**: These are specialized Sending Stones, likely crafted for a specific purpose, functioning as the auditory and command link between the Spellthief user and the bound wizard. They are typically worn by the user, operating much like an in-ear headset. There may be one or two such stones for redundancy or improved communication.
    
- **Stats & Vulnerabilities**:
    
    - **Nature**: Sturdy object (made of stone).
        
    - **Armor Class (AC)**: 12
        
    - **Hit Points (HP)**: 5 (per stone)
        
    - **Key Function**: Maintain the magical link, allowing the user to communicate commands and the bound wizard to receive them for remote spellcasting.
        
    - **Critical Vulnerability**: Breaking or interfering with a Sending Stone's function severs the connection to the bound wizard, preventing remote spellcasting until the link is re-established.
        
    - **Methods of Interference**:
        
        - Physical Destruction: Crushing the stone (requiring sufficient force/damage).
            
        - Magical Disruption: Effects like a _Silence_ spell targeting the stone/user, or potentially using spells like _Animate Object_ on the stone to disrupt its function.
            
        - Hijacking/Tuning: Resourceful individuals might find ways to intercept or tune into the communication frequency (DM discretion).

# The Union

- **Description**: The Union is a collective of workers in Waterdeep, primarily from the Industrial Port, advocating for fair wages, workplace safety, and regulations to protect worker dignity and life. It was founded by Cig and Alga after the death of their firstborn child in an accident, though previous structures had existed. The Union has an estimated fluctuating membership of 300 to 400 individuals.
    
- **Faction Structure**: It operates as a grassroots effort without a clear leader; Cig and Alga are founders but not bosses. A widespread network of "fields" coordinates efforts without bureaucracy or a paper trail ("unity of the fields"). Alga handles administrative tasks such as collecting funds, hosting and feeding protesters, and using soft power to expand influence. The group cooperates with the Harpers and maintains friendly relations with several established "vigilante" justice seekers.
    
- **Philosophy**: The Union adheres to the Sword Coast equivalent of Socialist ideology, aiming to uphold workers' rights and dismantle the monopoly on money, power, and violence held by the Waterdeep elite.
    

# The Upper City Elite

    - **Key Characteristics**:
        
        - **Residences**: Primarily home to sprawling villas and fortified residences of Waterdeep's noble families and affluent non-nobles, often walled and well-guarded.
            
        - **Inhabitants**: Includes public Lords of Waterdeep, high-ranking city officials, established nobility, and exceptionally wealthy merchants or guild masters who have attained sufficient status.
            
        - **Lifestyle**: Characterized by privilege and isolation from common city dwellers, involving elaborate social gatherings, political maneuvering, and management of vast wealth and reputation.
            
        - **Security**: The most heavily patrolled ward, secured by the City Guard and private house guards. Gates control access, and unauthorized presence is discouraged.
            
        - **Influence**: Residents wield significant political and economic power, influencing laws, trade, and social norms. Interactions are often formal and require strict social etiquette.

# Spellthief ("Remote Spellcaster")

- **Description**: This device (likely arcane/tech-based) allows a user to remotely cast spells drawn from a bound wizard. It consists of a core device, often in a sturdy case, connected to the user via a strap or belt, and linked to the wizard through one or more Sending Stones serving as headsets.
    
- **Key Mechanics**:
    
    - **Remote Spellcasting**: Enables the user to cast a limited number of spells known by the bound wizard, similar to scrolls but with flexibility from the wizard's spell list.
        
    - **Risk of Overload**: Casting too many or high-level spells can overload the device, leading to unforeseen consequences (DM discretion).
        
    - **Cost to Bound Wizard**: Using the Spellthief heavily taxes the bound wizard, who expends their prepared spell slots daily through this connection.
        
    - **Homebrew Rule: Arcane Burnout**: When a Wizard or Sorcerer (specifically the bound wizard) casts spells beyond their daily spell slot capacity, they gain levels of exhaustion.
        
    - **User Benefit**: The Spellthief user does not expend their own spell slots.
        
- **Defensive Stats & Vulnerabilities**:
    
    - **Core Device HP**: 25 HP.
        
    - **Protective Case**: The device is typically in a sturdy case that must be destroyed first (Case AC/HP to be defined separately).
        
    - **Attachment (Strap/Belt)**: Secured by a strap/belt (Strap AC/HP to be defined separately); severing it causes the device to drop.
        
    - **Armor Class (AC)**: Low for the device itself (e.g., 10-12), higher when in its case.
        
    - **Damage Vulnerabilities**: Lightning.
        
    - **Damage Resistances**: Necrotic.
        
    - **Key Component: Sending Stone(s)**: Sturdy (like stone, e.g., AC 12, HP 5); breaking one or interfering with communication severs the link to the bound wizard.
        
    - **Vulnerability to User Incapacitation**: If the user is incapacitated (e.g., Hold Person, Stunned, Paralyzed), they cannot manually trigger the device to cast spells, including safeguards.
        
    - **Vulnerability to Bound Wizard Inattention**: Due to long shifts, the bound wizard may be inattentive. Upon entering combat, there is a 30-60% chance (adjustable) that the Spellthief user cannot cast spells until the start of the second combat round. Players can exploit this by timing attacks.
        
    - **Bound Wizard Emergency Protocol**: A protocol is needed for the bound wizard if the connection is severed or fails.
        
- **Safeguard: Counterspell**:
    
    - The device has an ever-ready _Counterspell_ reaction.
        
    - Uses a 3rd-level spell slot from the bound wizard.
        
    - Automatically counters 3rd-level spells or lower.
        
    - Requires a spellcasting ability check (DC 10 + spell level) for 4th/5th level spells.
        
    - Cannot counter 6th-level spells or higher.
        
    - Certain metamagic (like Subtle Spell, potentially Heightened Spell) or class-specific spells/abilities grant the opposing spellcaster advantage on checks to bypass the _Counterspell_.
        
- **Sensory Imprint**:
    
    - **Sight**: A small, sturdy box with clunky mechanical buttons that make a satisfying click. It is attached with a belt and contains a glowing blue liquid (Sussur flower extract).
        
    - **Hear**: A whirring noise, only discernible by those attuned to magic (Arcana Check). It only produces noise when in use (buttons, talking via sending stone).
        
    - **Smell**: The static energy of the weave, akin to a perceptible phone connection (Arcana Check necessary).
        
    - **Touch**: Warm to the touch, potentially overheating. Sturdy, mechanical tech with tactile buttons that produce a loud clicking sound.
        
    - **Taste**: Not specified.
        
- **Additional Information**:
    
    - **Bound Wizard Emergency Protocol**:
        
        - **Protocol Trigger**: Initiated if the connection is severed, experiences interference, or if automatic safeguards fail.
            
        - **Actions Available**:
            
            - **Arcane Scan (Detect Magic)**: Wizard casts Detect Magic focusing on the user's location to identify magical interference or spells affecting the Spellthief/user.
                
            - **Remote Sight (Via Sending Stone)**: In an emergency, the wizard can attempt a limited visual feed through the stone (if a partial link exists), similar to a distorted camera.
                
            - **Remote Defensive Ward**: The wizard may attempt to cast a powerful defensive spell (like _Invulnerability_ or similar) targeting the Spellthief user remotely.
                
            - **Manual Trigger Bypass**: A limited, risky ability to remotely trigger a specific, simple pre-set spell, bypassing the user. This is heavily regulated.
                
        - **Limitations**: Actions are taxing and subject to the wizard's exhaustion or other factors. The Remote Defensive Ward is particularly limited by the availability of high-level spell slots due to daily strain.

# The Skeleton

- **Description**: The headless Skeleton is the first known case of a rune-ink corrupted entity roaming Waterdeep. The glowing flesh and bones move with great effort, tearing and straining under the unnatural energy oozing out of it. Despite its appearance, it is not Undead - the creature does not detect as undead, and does not react to spells targeting them. Its head, some ribs, fingers on the right hand, and left arm are missing. It seems to be blind.
    
- **Stats**:
    
    - **Armor Class**: 13 (Rune-Hardened Bones)
        
    - **Hit Points**: 37 (5d8 + 15)

        - Intelligence: 6 (-2)
            
        - Wisdom: 8 (-1)
            
        - Charisma: 5 (-3)

    - **Languages**: Understands Common but cannot speak.
        
    - **Challenge**: 1 (200 XP) - _Suggested, adjust based on play_
        
    - **Traits**:
        
        - **Not Undead**: The Skeleton is not considered an Undead creature. It does not detect as Undead and is immune to spells and effects that specifically target Undead.
            
        - **Glowing Form**: The Skeleton sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius due to the volatile rune-ink within its form. It cannot benefit from being in darkness.
            
        - **Rune Emanation (AoE, Custom)**: The Skeleton constantly emits volatile rune energy in a 15-foot radius. Any creature starting its turn within this radius must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) necrotic damage and experience severe headache. On a failed save, the creature also risks Rune Poisoning.
            
        - **Suppression Weakness (Custom)**: The Rune Emanation is suppressed if the Skeleton is fully encased in a material that blocks arcane energy, such as lead or specifically prepared molten metal.
            
    - **Actions**:
        
        - **Slam**: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 2 (1d4) radiant damage.
            
    - **Associated Effects (Custom)**:
        
        - **Rune Poisoning (Permanent)**: A condition contracted from prolonged exposure or repeated failed saves against Rune Emanation. It can worsen over time, potentially leading to transformation into a Rune-Marked Skeleton. This condition requires powerful magic to cure.
            
- **Loot**: Rune-ink infused bones that still emit dangerous radiation. They might be valuable as evidence or as an alchemic ingredient and need to be stored in a safe container.
    
- **Rune Ink Contamination**: High (hurry up and leave asap!)
    

# The Sludge

- **Description**: The sludge is what remains of Sami's flesh and skin after succumbing to spellrot. It is a glowing, neither-dead-nor-alive sludge that has developed its own consciousness. It resides in the sewers of Waterdeep and has gradually accumulated "material" from other creatures. Composed of both animal and human bones, as well as flesh and organs from various sources, the creature is entirely unique.
    

# The Skull

- **Description**: Sami's skull and left arm were missing from the skeleton and were presumably never found, leading to her burial without these body parts. The rune ink concentration within them is extremely high. It is assumed they were removed for "safekeeping," but these body parts now pose a greater risk than initially anticipated.
    

# Glowing Woman

- **Description**: A glowing woman is typically a retired Rune painter whose skeleton softly glows through her skin. She may possess arcane abilities due to her illness. While not technically a monster, their skillset is best represented by this category.
    
- **Stats**:
    
    - **Armor Class**: 10
        
    - **Hit Points**: 7 (2d8 - 2)
        
    - **Speed**: 30 ft.
        
    - **Ability Scores**:
        
        - Strength: 10 (+0)
            
        - Dexterity: 10 (+0)

        - Wisdom: 10 (+0)
            
        - Charisma: 10 (+0)
            
    - **Skills**: Arcana +3
        
    - **Senses**: Passive Perception 10
        
    - **Languages**: Common
        
    - **Challenge**: 1/8 (25 XP)
        
    - **Traits**:
        
        - **Faint Glow**: In dim light or darkness, the Glowing Woman's skeleton emits a faint, phosphorescent glow visible through her skin, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius.
            
        - **Rune Sickness**: The Glowing Woman suffers from the chronic effects of rune poisoning. She has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws against disease and poison (including effects like the Rune Emanation). Her lifespan is significantly reduced.
            
        - **Infused Cantrips**: The Glowing Woman can cast the following cantrips, using her infused blood as a somatic component (spellcasting ability Intelligence, spell save DC 11, +3 to hit with spell attacks): Chill Touch, Prestidigitation.
            
    - **Actions**:
        
        - **Unarmed Strike**: Melee Weapon Attack: +0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 (1d4 - 1) bludgeoning damage.
            
- **Rune Ink Contamination**: Low (headache, dizziness)
# Waterdeep

- **Description**: Waterdeep, known as the "City of Splendors," is a major city on the Sword Coast of Faerûn. It is a vibrant and important metropolis, serving as a significant port, trading hub, and center of culture, knowledge, and political power. The city is a melting pot of various races and peoples. It is governed by seventeen mysterious Lords of Waterdeep, with the publicly known Open Lord currently being Laeral Silverhand. Laws are strict and enforced by the City Watch and Guard. Notable landmarks include Mount Waterdeep, Deepwater Harbor, the Trollwall, and the City of the Dead (a cemetery also used as a public park). Waterdeep is divided into distinct wards, each with its own character, such as the wealthy Sea Ward, the administrative Castle Ward, the mercantile Trades Ward, the bustling Dock Ward, the residential North Ward, the transit-heavy Southern Ward, and the rough Field Ward. Waterdeep offers both immense opportunity and hidden dangers for adventurers, merchants, and schemers.

    - **Unstable Rune Ink Pot**: Sealed pot with a small amount of finished, volatile ink. Unpredictable results if used (minor wild magic or unstable magic table) or requires successful Arcana check (DC 13+). Value: 25-50 gp if stabilized, otherwise risky.
        
    - **Burned Journal Page**: Charred page with cryptic notes about "symbiotic integration," "Underdark catalysts," and warnings of "containment failure." Provides clues about the incident. Value: Clue/Lore.
        
    - **Personal Trinket**: Worker's metal charm bracelet permanently welded to the floor.
        
    - **Corrupted Crystal Shards**: Crystal bits tainted with the area's energy, faintly humming or pulsing. Potentially usable for corrupted foci or components, but handling may require gloves or DC 10 Dexterity save to avoid minor energy discharge. Value: 5-10 gp per shard (1d6 shards possible).
        
- **Entryways**:
    
    - **Barred door from outside**: Heavily guarded, enforced with Arcane Lock. Requires overcoming guards and a DC 25 Strength check OR DC 20 Thieves' Tools check + Dispel Magic (DC 18).

    - **Ventilation System**: Small, likely contaminated maintenance ducts or air vents. May require squeezing (DC 5-10) and Constitution saves against airborne contaminants (DC 13+). Access points might be hidden or require skill checks (DC 15+ Investigation/Perception).
        
    - **Collapsed Section (Exterior Wall/Ceiling)**: Weak point, potentially from the incident, offering precarious entry. Requires climbing checks (DC 15-20) and potentially Acrobatics/Stealth checks to avoid collapsing debris or alerting guards.
        
- **Arcane Access Points**: Military Waypoint
    
- **Crowd Behavior**: The area is mostly empty.
    
- **Hidden or Blocked Areas**: The hole leads into the workshop basement and further down. A toxic blue ooze, "The Sludge," formed where heated material cooled, corroding metal, stone, and steel. Venturing down requires Dexterity and Constitution saves. The tunnel accesses the basement, mine shafts, and a natural cave system. The heavy radiation has contaminated the area, potentially corrupting any creatures present.

# The Rune Workshop

- **Description**: The workshop is where all rune-ink infused devices and objects, including Waypoints, are created. It is the oldest of its kind in the region, utilizing materials from a nearby Underdark mine. Many workers are gnomes, dwarves, and drow. Stonemasons chisel runes into stone for Waypoints, rune inkers draw blueprints and infuse products, and alchemists create the ink. The workshop has a distinct chemical stench, and workers appear sickly. Currently, there are fewer workers than usual.

    - 8: A chipped stone carving tool that vibrates faintly. (Contamination Risk: Low - causes hand tremor)
        
    - 9: A half-finished, non-magical trinket with a strange rune. (Contamination Risk: Low - feels 'wrong')
        
    - 10: A small, tarnished silver locket with a tiny, faded rune inside. (Contamination Risk: Moderate - lingering dull ache after holding)

# The Cave System

- **Description**: This sprawling cave system beneath the city is home to various light-sensitive wildlife.

# Asami (Sami)

- **Description**: Asami, often called Sami, was a young rune painter. She is now a skeletal figure haunting the streets of Waterdeep.
    
- **Occupation**: Rune painter (former).
    
- **Ghost**: She was exposed to extremely high levels of rune poison in an accident. Her skin sloughed off, revealing glowing bones. She now roams the streets, consumed by pain and rage.
    
- **Lie**: "Everyone can become wealthy if they just try."
    
- **Need**: A peaceful end.
    
- **Want**: To climb the career ladder, become an overseer of the workshop, and escape poverty.
    
- **Opposition**: Becoming a skeleton zombie creature.
    
- **Strengths**: 3641219 (Numerical value provided without context).
    
- **Weaknesses**: 2498688 (Numerical value provided without context).
    
- **Beliefs**: "If I work hard enough, I'll make it!"
    
- **Behavior**: As a human, she was driven and career-focused. She was a mentor and friend to coworkers, especially her best friend Mergild, whom she often tutored in runing skills after work.
    
- **Additional Information (Story Details)**:
    
    - **The Accident**: Asami's ambition led her to an experimental chamber with unstable rune ink. A human error—an improperly secured containment seal or misjudged ventilation—caused a massive dose of rune poison. She appeared to recover for days before the irreversible symptoms manifested.
        
    - **Rune Poisoning & The Haunting**: Asami suffers from advanced Rune Poisoning, which mimics severe radiation sickness. Her flesh peeled away, and unstable rune energies etched into her skeleton animate her and cause her bones to glow. Her presence radiates poisonous energy (Rune Emanation AoE). Prolonged exposure to her or repeated failures against her emanation risk inflicting Rune Poisoning, potentially transforming victims into Rune-Marked Skeletons. Asami attacks erratically, driven by pain and rage.
        
- **Extra Information**: An orphan taken in by Alga at 14. She quickly befriended Mergild and was less close to Cig, whose politics she didn't understand. She was unbothered by Alga's discreet union involvement, as she herself avoided union membership to protect her career aspirations.
    
- **Non-Player Character Type**: Supporting.

# The Industrial Port

- **Description**: The Industrial sector of the Dock Ward is the bustling heart of Waterdeep's industry. Its cobbled streets are frequented mainly by workers. It is a hub for cargo ships, manufacturing plants, and workshops crucial to the Sword Coast's waypoint network. The area is highly magical, with portworkers using arcane machinery and stonemasons teleporting to chisel and infuse spellrunes. The port smells of the seaside, and large sailing boats are docked. The largest waypoint in the city, used for industrial hauls, is located at Sailor's Dock (Pier 1). Workers are constantly busy, shouts echo across decks, and breaks are brief moments for cigarettes and camaraderie.

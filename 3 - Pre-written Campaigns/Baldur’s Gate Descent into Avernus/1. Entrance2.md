# 1. Entrance

The tunnel from *level 20* leads to a featureless, 20-foot-high cavern with four tunnel exits, two of which contain iron tracks. An empty mine cart rests at the end of the northern track.

> ##### Mine Tracks and Carts
>
>The Terminus Level has iron tracks throughout, and iron mine carts ride the rails. Since the tracks are built on slopes, carts are secured with chocks—two sets of two zurkhwood blocks attached to one another by a length of rope. If its chocks are removed, a cart begins to roll. Its initial speed of 10 feet increases by 10 feet every round until it comes to the end of its track or reaches its maximum speed of 60 feet. A cart stops if it hits a stopped cart or the iron guard barrier at either end of the track.
>
>Each cart weighs 300 pounds empty and is equipped with a hand brake. A creature inside a cart or next to one can use its action to pull the hand brake to reduce the cart's speed by up to 30 feet, bringing it to a stop if its speed drops to 0.
>
>Moving out of the way of a rolling cart requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, and any creature struck by a cart takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage.

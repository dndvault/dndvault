# Wandering Monsters

Halaster continues to use the Terminus Level as a dumping ground for stray monsters. Duergar also patrol the mines.

#### Beholder Zombies

Four **beholder zombies**, set loose by Halaster, wander the Terminus Level. Once they're destroyed, no more are encountered.

#### Duergar Patrol

The characters encounter six **duergar** (three males and three females) on patrol, their heavy helms and armor dripping with blood (see "Regional Effects"). These duergar have orders to deliver adventurers to **Valtagar Steelshadow** unharmed. If a fight breaks out, they use Enlarge and defend themselves. If the battle goes poorly for them, the duergar turn invisible, retreat, and report to Valtagar in area 15.

#### Remorhaz

Released here by Halaster, this **remorhaz** creeps up on the characters and attacks. There is a 50 percent chance that a passing duergar patrol (see above) hears the ruckus and arrives on the scene at the end of the third round of combat. If the remorhaz is still around, the duergar help defeat it. Afterward, the duergar grumble that the remorhaz is but the latest monstrosity the Mad Mage has loosed in the mines. They otherwise behave as any other duergar patrol.

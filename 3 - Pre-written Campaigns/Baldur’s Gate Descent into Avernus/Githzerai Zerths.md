# Githzerai Zerths

Four githzerai zerths have taken refuge in the Obstacle Course. They use their psychic abilities and natural stealth to hide from Halaster's magical gaze and the death tyrant's watchful eyes.

The githzerai are aware that githyanki have conquered the Crystal Labyrinth (*level 16*) and are waging war against a mind flayer colony in Seadeeps (*level 17*). The githzerai wait patiently to see the outcome of the Seadeeps conflict but stand ready to assist should the githyanki need help. The leader of this githzerai band, Yrlakka, is a member of the Sha'sal Khou, a faction of renegade githyanki and githzerai who seek to reunify the gith races. By helping the githyanki defeat a common foe, Yrlakka hopes to demonstrate the merits of a single unified gith raceâ€”not only to the evil githyanki, but also to the younger githzerai zerths who follow him. Yrlakka is concerned because his most headstrong pupil, a githzerai named Ezria, has disappeared. He fears (correctly) that Ezria was captured by the githyanki on *level 16* while trying to find weak spots in their defenses.

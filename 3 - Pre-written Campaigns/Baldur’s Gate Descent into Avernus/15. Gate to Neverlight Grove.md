# 15. Gate to Neverlight Grove

A pair of 15-foot-tall standing stones dominates this room, the ceiling of which rises 30 feet high. The stones are covered with moss and have clumps of colorful mushrooms growing on them.

If a creature uses a finger or a staff to trace Halaster's rune on the surface of either of the standing stones, a gate forms between them and lasts for 1 minute. A *legend lore* spell or similar magic reveals the way to activate the gate, its destination, and the fact that it's one-way only. Any creature that steps through this gate appears, along with any objects it is wearing or carrying, in Neverlight Grove, a fungus-filled cavern deep in the Underdark. (More information on *Neverlight Grove* can be found in *Out of the Abyss*.)

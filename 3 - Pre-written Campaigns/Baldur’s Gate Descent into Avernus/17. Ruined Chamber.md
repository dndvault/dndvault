# 17. Ruined Chamber

What's left of this room is perched above the lava at the north end of the spectral bridge (area 16). Most of the chamber was destroyed when the chasm was created, but the following features remain:

>**Frescoes**. Damaged frescoes cling to the few walls that weren't destroyed by the chasm's formation. These frescoes depict obscene orgies between drow and demons.
>
>**Door Carving**. Covering the north door (to area 18) is a silver-inlaid carving of a spider's web.

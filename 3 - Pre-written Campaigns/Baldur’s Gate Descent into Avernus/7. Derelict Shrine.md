# 7. Derelict Shrine

An incomplete statue partially hewn from marble stands in the middle of the area. The stone is carved into the rough shape of the god Torm. Someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check identifies the statue's unfinished features as the iconography of the god of duty, loyalty, and law.

# 10. Noble Quarters

This suite belongs to **Melissara Shadowdusk**, a distant cousin of the Shadowdusk twins, and her deranged husband, Derrion.

#### 10a. Melissara's Chamber

>**Melissara**. A middle-aged woman (**Melissara Shadowdusk**) sits in an easy chair in the northeast corner, reading and muttering to herself.
>
>**Other Furnishings**. A canopied bed and an armoire stand against the south wall, and a silk curtain obscures a corridor to the north.
>
>**Secret Door**. A secret door in the east wall opens into Melissara's study (area 11).

Melissara has so far managed to escape the horrible insanity that besets the rest of her family, but she can sense that her mind is slowly being eroded by contact with the Far Realm. Fearing that her descent into madness is inevitable, she lives in a state of self-imposed exile and chooses to remain in Shadowdusk Hold despite every instinct telling her to flee.

Melissara is a human **archmage**, with these changes:

- Melissara is neutral.
- She speaks Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, and Dwarvish.
- She has the *dimension door* spell prepared instead of *banishment*.

If the characters address her in a civilized manner, Melissara listens to what they have to say. She then implores them to destroy Dezmyr and Zalthar before they can enact their plan to conquer Waterdeep, not realizing that death knights are not so easily vanquished. Melissara asks that she and Derrion be left out of the ensuing conflict and provides the following information to the characters in good faith:

- All members of the Shadowdusk family have, to some extent, been corrupted by the Far Realm. To the best of Melissara's knowledge, the damage is irreparable.
- Other family members living in Shadowdusk Hold include Melissara's three cousins: the wizards Berlain, Cassiok, and Vertrand.
- Dezmyr and Zalthar are death knights that dwell on the lower tiers of Shadowdusk Hold. Contact with the Far Realm has given Dezmyr the ability to warp reality to a limited extent. Zalthar has no such ability but wields a sword that drains souls.
- The lowest tier of Shadowdusk Hold is home to a blue dracolich in league with the death knights. (Melissara knows the dracolich's phylactery is hidden somewhere in Shadowdusk Hold, but doesn't know where.)

If the characters have no interest in conversing with Melissara, she uses *dimension door* to get to area 11 and sends her lunatic husband to eliminate them.

***Treasure.*** The armoire holds fine clothing and a wooden jewelry box containing a pair of matching gold bracelets (250 gp each), a gold-and-pearl necklace (1,250 gp), and the key to the strongbox in area 10b.

#### 10b. Derrion's Chamber

>**Derrion**. A middle-aged man with a scarred face (Derrion Shadowdusk) is pacing about the room anxiously.
>
>**Furnishings**. These include a simple bed to the west, a dresser filled with clothes to the east, and a weapon and armor rack.

![{@creature Dezmyr Shadowdusk|WDMM}](img/adventure/WDMM/074-22-04.webp)

Derrion enjoys killing unwelcome visitors. He is a human **champion** (see *appendix A*), with these changes:

- Derrion is chaotic evil.
- He speaks Common and Deep Speech.
- Derrion stores his weapons and plate armor on the equipment racks. If he doesn't have time to don his plate armor, he makes do with a chain shirt (AC 15).

Derrion accompanies Melissara whenever she leaves their suite, fearing that she will come to harm without his protection. He lives in constant fear that adventurers might invade Shadowdusk Hold and lay waste to it. Prolonged exposure to the Far Realm has made him sleep-deprived and irritable. His eyes are bloodshot, and he hears whispers of things that aren't real. Only Melissara can control his inexplicable rage toward visitors.

***Treasure.*** Under the bed is a locked strongbox containing 200 pp and 1,000 gp. The key in area area 10a unlocks the strongbox, which can also be opened with a *knock* spell or similar magic, or by a character using thieves' tools who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check.

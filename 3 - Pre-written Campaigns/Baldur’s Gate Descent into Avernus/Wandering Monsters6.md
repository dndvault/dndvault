# Wandering Monsters

The magical emanations of the Runestone attract earth-dwelling creatures such as bulettes, earth elementals, purple worms, and xorn to this level. The characters might also come across an expedition that has traveled from Shadowdusk Hold.

#### Shadowdusk Expedition

An expeditionary force has been sent from Shadowdusk Hold (*level 22*) to collect Runestone fragments. The force consists of a chaotic evil human **archmage** named Akarrth Shadowdusk, a **beholder** named Gz'zarp, two **grells**, and two **nothics**. The grells and nothics are Akarrth's servants, the beholder his tenuous ally.

The characters can easily strike up an alliance with Akarrth, but any such pact is doomed to crumble in short order because the archmage is insane.

***Treasure.*** Akarrth carries a wooden rod carved with tentacles that serves as an arcane focus (10 gp), as well as a spellbook bound in mind flayer skin that contains all the spells he has prepared.

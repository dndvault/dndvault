# 18. Ruined Shrine

This room stands empty except for fist-sized bas-reliefs of spiders at various heights along the walls. The furnishings of the shrine were either destroyed by the formation of the chasm or disintegrated by the death tyrant. What remains is an empty chamber with a crumbling ledge that overlooks a lava pool 30 feet below.

Characters who make no effort to conceal themselves as they approach the ledge are spotted by the creatures frolicking in area 40d: six **lava children** (see *appendix A*) and seven **magma mephits**. See area 40d for details.

#### Treasure

A character who searches the north wall and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check discovers that one of the spider carvings on that wall can be detached. The carving is 6 feet off the floor, weighs 10 pounds, and acts as a plug sealing a stone tube. Removing the plug causes 250 pp to cascade out of the tube onto the floor.

The stove was given a semblance of life through an *animate objects* spell made permanent by a *wish* spell. It tears free of its stovepipe and charges forward on clawed feet to attack intruders.

The stove is a Large construct with a challenge rating of 3 (700 XP). It has AC 17, 50 hit points, a walking speed of 30 feet, and the following ability scores: Strength 14, Dexterity 10, Constitution 10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1. It has blindsight out to a range of 30 feet and is blind beyond this distance. It has the following action options:

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 11 (2d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

***Belch Fire (Recharge 4â€“6).*** The stove belches fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Treasure.*** There are twenty-four wooden coffers in all, each one labeled in Common with the name of a spell and containing all the material components for one or more castings of that spell. The following table summarizes the coffers' contents:

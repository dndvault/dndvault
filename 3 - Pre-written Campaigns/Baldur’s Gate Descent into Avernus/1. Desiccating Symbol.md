# 1. Desiccating Symbol

At the end of the tunnel that leads down from *level 19*, **Ezzat** has inscribed a glyph on the floor using a modified version of the *symbol* spell, requiring a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to spot. Cast using a 9th-level spell slot, the glyph triggers the death effect (save DC 20) when any creature crosses over it. After the effect is triggered, ghostly skulls float above the area where the glyph is inscribed.

# 14. Man with the Rabbit's Head

A short, plump, rabbit-headed man wearing a dirty servant's uniform cowers in the square marked X on map 23. "**Rabbithead**" is a **commoner**, with these changes:

- **Rabbithead** is unaligned and unarmed (0 XP).
- He has the head of a rabbit. He can't speak and knows no languages.

This poor fellow is a rabbit transformed by **Arcturia**'s magic into a unique humanoid. The transformation is permanent and can't be undone except with a *wish* spell. Because he's no longer a beast, *speak with animals* can't be used to communicate with him. A character who examines the creature and succeeds on a DC 19 Intelligence (Arcana) check can confirm that it exhibits the traits of a rabbit that has been given humanoid form by a *true polymorph* spell rendered permanent.

**Rabbithead** retreated here to escape **Arcturia**'s presence and latches onto the adventurers, hoping they'll protect him from her wrath. Characters who succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check can glean that the source of his fear is somewhere to the south, and indeed he grows more nervous the closer he gets to area 17.

If **Rabbithead** is shown the yellow sapphires from area 8, he indicates through gestures and furtive glances that the missing ones are kept in area 17.

# 24. Nothic Warrens

This wing of Shadowdusk Hold serves as the home of family members whose mad thirst for arcane knowledge transformed them into **nothics**.

#### 24a. Communal Area

Twelve **nothics** gather here and glare suspiciously at strangers while spouting nonsense among themselves. If the characters do anything to startle the nothics, they attack; otherwise, the nothics let characters pass through this room unmolested.

#### 24b. Peek-a-Boo

Two **nothics** cower beneath mounds of rotting tapestries piled against the east wall. The nothics sheepishly observe passersby and avoid combat.

#### 24c. Rotting Refuse

The **nothics** throw garbage here, including the half-eaten corpses of rats, bats, and other vermin. The shredded remains of a tapestry depicting the city of Waterdeep hang on the south wall.

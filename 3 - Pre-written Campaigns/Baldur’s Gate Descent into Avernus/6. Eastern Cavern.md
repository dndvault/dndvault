# 6. Eastern Cavern

The githyanki knocked down several walls to create this chamber, and much of the debris remains.

#### 6a. Mirrk's Watch

>**Crystal Stalactite**. A 10-foot-long crystal stalactite hangs above a pit filled with silvery mist. Encased in the stalactite is Mirrk, a female **githyanki gish** (see *appendix A* for statistics; see also "Crystal Stalactites").
>
>**Guards**. Unless they have been lured elsewhere, six **githyanki warriors** (three females and three males) stand guard around the edge of the pit in the squares marked W on map 16.
>

The warriors speak in Gith about their dislike of **Al'chaia** and their respect for Urlon. They are hostile toward intruders and fight until three or more of them fall, whereupon the remaining warriors retreat to area 7 or dive into the pit.

Creatures that fall into the pit are immediately transported to the Astral Plane (see *chapter 2* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for more information).

#### 6b. Scrying Chamber

The north wall of this chamber hums and glows purple. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of divination magic radiating from the wall. Any creature that spends 1 minute touching the wall can cast the *scrying* spell targeting the ulitharid on *level 17*, using the wall as a focus. A character who examines the wall can, with a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check, ascertain that it's a scrying device and figure out how it works.

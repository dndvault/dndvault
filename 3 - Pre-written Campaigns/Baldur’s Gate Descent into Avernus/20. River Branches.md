# 20. River Branches

The river (see "Underground River") reaches a depth of 20 feet at this point, where it splits off in three directions. A creature swept along by the river's strong current is pulled in a random direction determined by rolling a d6. On a 1, the creature is swept into area 12a. On a 2, the creature is swept into area 12b. On any other result, the creature is swept into area 12c.

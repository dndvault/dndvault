# 19. Ezzat's Scrying Mirror

Mounted on the south wall 6 inches above the floor is a 3-foot-wide, 9-foot-tall rectangular mirror with a stone frame. Carved into the top of the frame is a human-sized eyeball.

**Ezzat** uses the mirror as a focus for his *scrying* spell. Whenever this mirror is used to scry Halaster, the spell appears to succeed automatically but shows a false image of Halaster sweeping a dungeon floor with a broom. The image pauses every few minutes to wave at the viewer, do a little dance, or strum the broom as if it were a guitar. **Ezzat** understands that this scene is one of Halaster's magical tricks, and he does not bother trying to scry the Mad Mage from here.

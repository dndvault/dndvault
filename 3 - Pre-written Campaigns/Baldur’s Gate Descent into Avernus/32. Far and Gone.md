# 32. Far and Gone

The curving west wall of this room is a seething mass of color and sickly lightâ€”a partially breached portal to the Far Realm. Creatures can't physically pass through the portal, but the Far Realm's influence bleeds out into the Material Plane from this place. A character can ascertain the true nature of the portal with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

Any creature that comes into contact with the back wall must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by the wall for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature is stunned and stares at the wall, absorbing the power and madness of the Far Realm. The effect ends if the creature takes damage, or if another creature uses an action to shake or slap it. When the effect ends, the creature that was charmed gains a random form of indefinite madness (see "*Madness*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

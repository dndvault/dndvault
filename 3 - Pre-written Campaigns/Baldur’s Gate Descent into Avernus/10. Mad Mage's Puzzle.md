# 10. Mad Mage's Puzzle

>**Indentation**. A 4-inch-deep, 8-foot-wide, 10-foot-long rectangular indentation is carved into the floor of this 20-foot-high cavern.
>
>**Jigsaw Pieces**. A loose pile of carved, painted stones stands near the south wall.
>

The pile contains ninety-nine chunks of stone, each weighing 25 pounds and carved in the shape of a jigsaw puzzle piece. The pieces form an image of Halaster, his head thrown back in laughter as he rides a great blue dragon. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can fit all the puzzle pieces together with 1 hour's work. If other characters assist, the character gains advantage on the check, but the time to complete the puzzle is not reduced. When all the pieces are placed, the characters realize that one puzzle piece is missing. (It can be found in area 9b.)

When all one hundred jigsaw puzzle pieces are placed properly in the rectangular indentation on the floor, an elder rune appears above it and targets a random creature in the cave (see "Elder Runes"). Draw a card from the Elder Runes Deck (*appendix B*) to determine which rune appears.

# 2. Clacking Floor

The stones that comprise the floor of this 10-foot-high chamber make clacking noises when stepped onâ€”a crude but effective alarm system installed by dwarves long ago. A character who searches the floor for traps before stepping on it discovers the hidden alarm system with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check.

A secret door in the west wall opens into area 3, and north of the room is a hidden pit trap.

#### Covered Pit

This hidden pit (see "Covered Pits") is 20 feet deep, but the bottom 10 feet is occupied by a **gelatinous cube**. Any creature that falls into the pit takes 10 (3d6) acid damage as it sinks into the cube and is automatically engulfed by it. If the cube is attacked from above, it rises out of the pit on its turn and tries to engulf anything in its path.

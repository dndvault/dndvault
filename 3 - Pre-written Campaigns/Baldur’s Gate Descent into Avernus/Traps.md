# Traps

The Obstacle Course is replete with mechanical and magical traps. Two recurring types are described below.

#### Covered Pits

Melairkyn dwarves built these pits, and Halaster keeps them in working order.

A 10-foot-square slab of 2-inch-thick stone covers each pit. Each cover is carved to resemble the floor surrounding the pit. A character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher recognizes the trapped section of floor as the cover of a pit. A character can also search the floor for traps, detecting the pit with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check. Once a pit is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit's cover and the surrounding floor to prevent the cover from opening. The cover can also be held in place using an *arcane lock* spell or similar magic.

When a weight of 25 pounds or more is placed on the cover, it swings downward (as long as it hasn't been prevented from opening) and remains open until Halaster happens by and decides to close it. Any creature or object on the cover when it swings open falls into the pit below. The pit's depth and other hazards vary by location, as described in the location's description. Regardless of a pit's depth, its walls are too smooth for characters to climb without the aid of climbing gear, magic, or the Spider Climb trait (or a similar ability).

#### Teleport Traps

Teleport traps are at the locations marked T on the map. A teleport trap is a magical effect usually cast on a 10-foot-square section of floor, set to trigger whenever a creature enters the trap's space. The trap extends all the way to the ceiling of the space that contains it.

A teleport trap is invisible to the senses, and a permanent *Nystul's magic aura* spell prevents divination spells such as *detect magic* from revealing the trap's presence. A successful *dispel magic* spell (DC 18) cast on the trapped section of floor destroys the trap.

A creature that enters the trap's space is teleported along with any objects it is wearing or carrying to another teleport trap (or the nearest unoccupied space). There is no saving throw to resist the teleportation effect, and the destination varies from trap to trap. Once a creature has been teleported in this way, it is unaffected by teleport traps on this level for 1 hour.

When a creature is teleported by a trap, Halaster's booming voice shouts "Teleported!" in Common. The magical voice originates at the point of departure and the point of arrival, and it is audible in both locations out to a range of 100 feet.

Some teleport traps have additional effects, as described in their encounter locations.

***Splitting the Party.*** Teleport traps are designed to split the party—a situation that can challenge any DM. To ensure that every member of a split party gets attention, think of yourself as a film editor cutting scenes in a movie. Jump from one group of characters to the next while spending no more than a few minutes with any given group or individual. Tense moments are great times to "cut" from one group to another—don't be afraid to leave them hanging!

> ##### Halaster's Play-By-Play
>
>Whenever a creature makes an attack roll, takes damage, or performs a death-defying stunt in the Obstacle Course, Halaster's disembodied voice magically chimes in with play-by-play commentary. The effect can't be dispelled, and its exact point of origin can't be ascertained. The play-by-play can be silenced for good by destroying the source in area 30b or by defeating the death tyrant Netherskull. Improvise the play-by-play as you see fit. The commentary tends to be sarcastic, biting, and demoralizing. A few examples of what the disembodied voice might say are provided below:
>
>- **When a character misses with a melee attack roll**: "Swing and a miss!"

>- **When a character misses with a ranged attack roll**: "Missed that one by a mile!"

>- **When a character takes damage**: "Ouch, that'll leave a mark!"

>- **When the characters kill a monster**: "Score one for the underdogs!"

>- **When the party cleric drops to 0 hit points**: "The cleric is down! Stick a fork in it—this party's done!"

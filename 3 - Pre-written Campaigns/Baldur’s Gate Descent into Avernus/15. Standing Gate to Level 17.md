# 15. Standing Gate to Level 17

Rising out of a 2-foot-deep pool of ooze is a pair of 15-foot-tall standing stones topped with a lintel, carved into which is a symbol of an arrow. The standing stones form a magic gate (see "Gates"). Its rules are as follows:

- If an arrow or a crossbow bolt is shot between the standing stones, the gate opens for 1 minute.
- Characters must be 14th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes").
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 8b on level 17, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.

# 5. Giggling Chasm

A 20-foot-wide, 70-foot-deep crevasse has opened up in the floor of this 20-foot-high cavern. The sound of an old man giggling rises from the depths of the crevasse every minute or so. This is a harmless illusion, one of **Halaster Blackcloak**'s regional effects (see "Halaster's Lair").

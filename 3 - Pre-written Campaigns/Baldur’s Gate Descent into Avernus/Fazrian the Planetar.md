# Fazrian the Planetar

**Fazrian** is a planetar formerly in the service of Torm, god of courage and self-sacrifice. The planetar was summoned to Undermountain months ago by an adventuring cleric. Sickened by the foulness it beheld, **Fazrian** sought to cleanse the Terminus Level of corruption, but the magic suffusing Halaster's abominations corrupted the planetar's divine zeal. The more horrors it destroyed, the more joy **Fazrian** took in their slaughter. **Fazrian**'s fall from grace was swift, culminating in the murder of the cleric and her companions. The planetar now passes judgment on all who stand before it. Those who lack the willingness to sacrifice themselves for a greater end (such as greedy treasure-seekers drawn to Undermountain for no other reason) are found guilty and executed.

A mote of goodness still burns within the planetar. If the characters can make **Fazrian** realize that it has become what it sought to destroy, the planetar will end itself and, with its self-sacrifice, earn Torm's forgiveness.

#### Regional Effects

The Terminus Level has been warped by **Fazrian**'s presence, which creates the following magical effects that end when the planetar dies:

- A faint breeze bears the scent of roses mixed with sulfur. Characters who try to track the breeze to its source are led toward **Fazrian** in area 23b. Warm blood oozes from the walls and drips from the ceiling, starting and stopping for no apparent reason. (The blood might attract ravenous, blood-drinking creatures such as stirges or vampire spawn.)
- The song of an unholy choir echoes through an area whenever a fight breaks out, then fades away when combat ends.

# 9. Miners' Quarters

This 10-foot-high room is constructed of interlocking, blood-streaked stone tiles. Rectangular stone slabs lie in neat rows against the east and west walls. These slabs once served as beds for dwarf miners, but they have not been used in centuries.

A thick layer of dust covers everything.

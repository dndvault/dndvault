# 40. Lynnorax's Lair

>**Ceiling**. This room has a 40-foot-high, domed ceiling.
>
>**Dracolich**. Lynnorax, an **adult blue dracolich**, faces the double door to the east and exhales lightning in that direction as soon as it sees intruders.
>
>**Pillars**. The four pillars that buttress the ceiling are carved out of black crystal and inscribed with arcane runes.

Lynnorax fights without fear, knowing that its phylactery (hidden in area 39) will preserve its life force if its skeletal body is destroyed.

A *detect magic* spell reveals auras of abjuration magic around the crystal pillars, which grant the dracolich a damage threshold of 40. While in this room, the dracolich doesn't take damage from any single source unless that damage is equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes the damage as normal. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the dracolich's damage threshold is magically negated by the pillars. Each time the pillars negate damage to the dracolich, their arcane runes glow brightly.

The dracolich loses the pillars' protection it leaves the room, so it prefers to fight here.

Each pillar is a Huge object with AC 13, 60 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying a pillar reduces the dracolich's damage threshold by 10.

# 13. Hidden Traps

Two traps are hidden in these unadorned halls.

#### 13a. Teleport Trap

A teleport trap (see "Teleport Traps") fills the 10-foot-square space marked on the map. A creature teleported by this trap arrives at a location determined by rolling a d20 and consulting the following table:

|  d20  | Teleport Destination          |
|:-----:|-------------------------------|
|  1–10 | The teleport trap in area 19  |
| 11–18 | The teleport trap in area 22a |
| 19–20 | The teleport trap in area 40c |

***Additional Effect: Summoned Devil.*** After a creature triggers the trap and is teleported away, an **ice devil** appears in the trap's space and attacks any other creatures it sees at the same moment a booming voice shouts, "Teleported!" The devil doesn't trigger any of the teleport traps on this level. It disappears when reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 minute. Each time the trap is triggered, a new ice devil appears.

#### 13b. Covered Pit

This hidden pit (see "Covered Pits") is 40 feet deep, and a creature that falls the distance takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. In addition, Halaster has cast a *glyph of warding* spell at the bottom of the pit, set to trigger a *cloudkill* spell (save DC 22) when a creature lands on the floor of the pit. The poisonous fog created by the spell fills the pit and lasts for 10 minutes. The spell is cast using an 8th-level spell slot. It deals 36 (8d8) poison damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

# 23. Statue of Vergadain

A 9-foot-tall **stone golem** carved in the likeness of Vergadain, the dwarven god of luck and wealth, stands in this alcove with shoulders squared and a smug look carved into its face. Dwarves immediately recognize Vergadain's likeness, while other characters can determine its identity with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check. Its eyes are glittering black sapphires that can't be pried loose until the golem is destroyed (see "Treasure" below).

The golem remains motionless until it is attacked or activated by the trap in area 22a. It has the following additional trait:

***Magic Theft.*** As a bonus action, the golem targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw, or all magic items in its possession are teleported to the bottom of the pit in area 31.

***Treasure.*** The two black sapphires embedded in the golem's eyes are worth 5,000 gp each.

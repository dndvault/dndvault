# Halaster Blackcloak

If the adventurers have made their way to this level, Halaster is equal parts impressed and curious. He is ready to grant the characters an audience, having kept an eye on their progress. True to the nature that earned him the moniker "Mad Mage," Halaster's demeanor toward the characters can change on a whim. He might alternate between seeming furious, baffled, annoyed, amusedâ€”or simply bored, depending on what the characters have accomplished before reaching this level. See *appendix A* for more information on the Mad Mage.

If the characters and their actions support Halaster's current goal (see "Halaster's Goals"), the Mad Mage is not necessarily hostile. For example, if his primary goal is to find an apprentice, Halaster has kept an eye on any arcane spellcasters in the party. He might suggest that those characters prove their worth by surviving the Mad Wizard's Lair and "freeing up" an apprenticeship by eliminating **Arcturia** or **Trobriand**. If this is done, Halaster is willing to take on an appropriate character as a new apprentice. Halaster has no sentimental attachment toward his apprentices, and he often enjoys secretly tormenting them.

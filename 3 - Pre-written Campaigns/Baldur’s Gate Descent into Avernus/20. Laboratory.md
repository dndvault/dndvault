# 20. Laboratory

**Table**. A stone table cluttered with decrepit alchemical apparatus and dirty bottles of reagents stands at the center of the room. Among the clutter on the table is a small clay bowl containing crystal pebbles (see "Runestone Fragments").

>**Cabinet**. A narrow cabinet with glass doors stands in the northwest corner.

>**Stairs**. A stone staircase with no railing hugs the outer wall and climbs to area 21.

The bowl contains six crystal pebbles, each one a Runestone fragment that has been collected by Ipses the pseudodragon (see area 14). Bringing a fragment to Jalester Silvermane in Waterdeep completes a quest (see "Retrieve a Runestone Fragment").

#### Treasure

Sitting on the top shelf of the cabinet are two *potions of resistance* (force and lightning). The other shelves are strewn with spell components, including two forked mithral rods (250 gp each). These are material components for the *plane shift* spell, attuned to the Astral Plane and the Shadowfell, respectively. They serve little use in Undermountain, given the dungeon's restrictions on such magic.

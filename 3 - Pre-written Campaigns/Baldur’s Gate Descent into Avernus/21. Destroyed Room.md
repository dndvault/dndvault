# 21. Destroyed Room

A crumbling ledge overlooks a great chasm brightly lit by a bubbling pool of lava 30 feet below. Characters who peer over the ledge can see several creatures frolicking in the lava.

Characters who make no effort to conceal themselves as they cross the room are detected and attacked by the creatures frolicking in the pool: six **lava children** (see *appendix A*) and seven **magma mephits**. See area 40d for details.

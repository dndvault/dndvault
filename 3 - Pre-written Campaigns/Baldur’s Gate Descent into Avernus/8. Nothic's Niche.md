# 8. Nothic's Niche

>**Fissure**. A **nothic** hides in a 5-foot-wide natural fissure in the 20-foot-high ceiling.
>
>**Furnishings**. A rectangular stone table with ten chairs stands at the center of the room. The table and the floor around it are strewn with debris from the crumbling ceiling.
>
>**Tapestry**. A great tapestry covers the west wall. It depicts a noble wedding inside a vast chamber that has shadowy tentacles sprouting from its dark corners.

The nothic uses the fissure in the ceiling as a private lair. It observes intruders and uses its Weird Insight on interesting-looking characters so it can later report any secrets it learns to **Dezmyr Shadowdusk**. It leaves the niche only if attacked and fights to the death to defend its lair.

#### Treasure

Stashed on a shelf inside the nothic's ceiling niche are 15 pp and 200 gp in a leather sack, and a *potion of supreme healing* in a glass vial fastened to a silver necklace (25 gp).

The tapestry depicts the ghastly wedding of Xerrion and Margaraste Shadowdusk. It is worth 750 gp and weighs 50 pounds.

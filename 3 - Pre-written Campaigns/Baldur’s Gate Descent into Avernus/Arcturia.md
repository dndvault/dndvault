# Arcturia

**Arcturia** is a lich and a master of transmutation magic. She has altered her form dramatically over the years, now appearing more alive than undead. Gossamer wings sprout from her shoulders, and bone spurs jut from her forearms and elbows.

If the characters destroyed her phylactery on level 14, **Arcturia** attacks them on sight. She has no beef with them otherwise.

# 39. Netherskull's Sanctum

![](img/adventure/WDMM/050-15-04.webp)

Adventurers who explore this area are doomed to face Netherskull the death tyrant if they haven't done so already. Netherskull can't be surprised in its lair.

#### 39a. Hanging Beholder Statue

Hanging from the 30-foot-high, domed ceiling by three iron chains is a 6-foot-diameter carved stone beholder. Netherskull carved the statue using its carefully manipulated Disintegration Ray, but the rough sculpture is clearly the work of a talentless amateur. Each chain has AC 19, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Breaking all three chains causes the statue to fall and shatter on the floor.

#### 39b. Secret Tunnel

This dusty passage circumvents the adamantine doors to Netherskull's lair (see area 39c) and is hidden behind two secret doors. The death tyrant uses its Telekinetic Ray to open and close the secret doors when it comes and goes through this tunnel.

#### 39c. Death Tyrant

All doors leading to this area are 1-foot-thick, 7-foot-diameter adamantine disks molded to look like concentric rings of bones with a leering human skull at the center. The skull's nose cavity contains an adamantine keyhole. When one of Halaster's bone keys (see areas 19 and area 30b) is inserted into the lock and turned 90 degrees clockwise, four bolt locks slide back from the surrounding walls, and the door swings inward on adamantine hinges. The door remains open until it is closed, and the key can be removed at any time. Without the proper key, it takes four separate *knock* spells to open one of these doors, each spell causing one bolt to slide back. The doors are otherwise impregnable.

There is no keyhole on the inside of the doors. Instead, each door has an adamantine wheel in the middle of it that must be turned counterclockwise to slide back the bolts. This wheel can also be used as a handle to pull the heavy door open. When Netherskull wants to leave the room through a door, it uses its Telekinetic Ray to turn the wheel and leaves the door open until it returns.

***Netherskull.*** Unless it has been defeated elsewhere, the **death tyrant** floats 30 feet above the stone-tiled floor of this 40-foot-high chamber. Netherskull seeks to destroy intruders and animate their corpses, turning them into zombie thralls. It calls forth the zombies in area 38 (assuming they haven't been defeated) and commands them to attack all intruders.

If the characters haven't silenced the level's play-by-play announcer (see "Halaster's Play-by-Play"), it becomes increasingly excited as the battle with the death tyrant unfolds. If they defeat Netherskull, the announcer screams, "How could this happen?! This is unbelievable! This might be the greatest upset in the history of Undermountain!" It then falls silent for the rest of the time the characters spend on this level.

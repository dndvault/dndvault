# Wandering Monsters

Most of the ooze that flows through this level is harmless elemental waste, but this level is also home to meandering Ghaunadaur worshipers and orog space pirates looking for food. You can use the following encounters to harry restless or resting adventurers.

#### Huge Gray Ooze

The characters encounter six Ghaunadaur-worshiping duergar who were transformed by Halaster's magic into a single **gray ooze** with a challenge rating of 8 (3,900 XP) and these changes:

- The ooze is Huge, with 152 (16d12 + 48) hit points and a Strength score of 18.
- As an action, it can make two attacks with its pseudopods (+7 to hit). On a hit, a pseudopod deals 21 (6d6) acid damage, or 42 (12d6) acid damage while the ooze is enlarged.
- The ooze has the Enlarge and Invisibility traits below.

***Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the ooze magically increases in size. While enlarged, the ooze is Gargantuan, doubles its damage dice with its pseudopod attack, and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage.

***Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The ooze magically turns invisible for up to 1 hour until it attacks, it uses its Enlarge, or its concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell).

#### Intelligent Black Puddings

The characters encounter two Ghaunadaur-worshiping drow who were transformed by Halaster's magic into **black puddings**, with these changes:

- The black puddings understand Elvish and Undercommon, but can't speak.
- Each pudding has an Intelligence of 14 and the following Innate Spellcasting trait:

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The pudding's spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). It can cast the following spells, requiring no components:

At will: *dancing lights*, *mage hand*

3/day each: *darkness*, *faerie fire*, *shield*

1/day: *Melf's acid arrow*

#### Space Orogs

The characters encounter 1d4 + 1 **orogs** hunting for easy prey. These orogs were raised in deep caverns on H'catha, a wheel-shaped planet ruled by beholders and the farthest world from Toril's sun. The orogs wear bucket helms resembling bulbous mind flayer heads, with large, glass-covered eye holes and tentacle-like breathing tubes.

In addition to its armor and weapons, each orog carries a *tangler grenade*. The orogs use these grenades to restrain foes before charging into melee.

***Tangler Grenades.*** A tangler grenade is an alchemical, nonmagical item with an ovoid resin shell that shatters on impact. An as action, a creature can throw a tangler grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 10 feet of a shattered tangler grenade must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by sticky white webs. As an action, a creature can try to free itself or another creature within its reach from the webs, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. A gallon of alcohol dissolves the webs produced by a single tangler grenade. Otherwise, the webs dissolve on their own after 1 hour, freeing any creatures restrained by them.

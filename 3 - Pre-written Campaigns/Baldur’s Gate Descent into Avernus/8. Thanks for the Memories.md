Halaster killed a beholder that sought to carve out a domain on this level. From its moldering corpse grew a host of gas spores. Inspection of the remains accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Medicine) check reveals that the beholder died from fire, force, and necrotic damage. Inspection also reveals a treasure (see "Treasure" below).

The gas spores carry the memories of the beholder that birthed them. A creature that inhales the spores inherits a random beholder memory, determined by rolling on the Beholder Memories table. These memories are experienced from the eye tyrant's point of view.

The walls of the sinkhole have abundant handholds and can be scaled with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### Treasure

The dead beholder has a gold tongue stud set with a peridot (750 gp).

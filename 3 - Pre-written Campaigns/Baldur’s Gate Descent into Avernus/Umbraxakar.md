# Umbraxakar

The shadow dragon **Umbraxakar** used to be a lawful good bronze dragon named **Glyster**. Fond of assuming human form, **Glyster** was Vanrak Moonstar's friend and companion, remaining by the noble's side even after Vanrak's fall from grace. **Glyster** tried to turn Vanrak away from the worship of Shar, to no avail, and the dragon sank into despair. In this forlorn state, he allowed Shar's priests to transform him into a shadow dragon to better serve Vanrak in the battles to come. Thereafter, **Glyster** became known as **Umbraxakar** ("Shadowborn" in Draconic).

The death knight and the shadow dragon fought side by side for many years, expanding their domain and then defending it against adventurers and other invaders. By this time, **Umbraxakar** had stopped caring about anything except his friendship with Vanrak. The friendship finally ended when Vanrak destroyed himself with a *sun blade*, leaving **Umbraxakar** and the remnants of Shar's wicked cult to fend for themselves.

#### Visions of Umbraxakar

As characters explore areas of Vanrakdoom, they experience magical visions of terrible things that the dragon experienced long ago. These visions, byproducts of **Umbraxakar**'s despair, provide clues that can help free the dragon from his dark curse. A character does not experience such visions within an antimagic field or while under the protection of a *dispel evil and good* spell.

Characters also encounter magical projections of **Umbraxakar**. These shadowy images take the form of harmless, dragon-shaped clouds of black fog. A projection that is targeted by a *dispel magic* spell or touched by an antimagic field is destroyed instantly. It otherwise cannot be harmed.

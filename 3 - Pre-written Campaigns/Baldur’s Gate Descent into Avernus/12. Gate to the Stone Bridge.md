# 12. Gate to the Stone Bridge

>**Standing Gate**. Two 15-foot-tall standing stones are positioned near the west wall of this 20-foot-high room.
>
>**Bas-Relief**. Spanning the wall behind the standing stones is a bas-relief depicting an armored dwarf with a greataxe fighting a hill giant atop a long, flat bridge.

The bas-relief depicts Torhild Flametongue, king of the ancient dwarven kingdom of Besilmer, fighting a mortal enemy atop the Stone Bridge, a monument that spans the River Dessarin to this day. With a successful DC 20 Intelligence (History) check, a character recalls the legendary battle and the king's fate (he was struck from the bridge and fell to his death).

If a creature uses a finger or a staff to trace Halaster's rune on the surface of either of the standing stones, a gate forms between them and lasts for 1 minute. A *legend lore* spell or similar magic reveals the way to activate the gate, its destination, and the fact that it's one-way only. Any creature that steps through this gate appears, along with any objects it is wearing or carrying, atop the middle of the Stone Bridge. (More information on this location can be found in *Princes of the Apocalypse*.)

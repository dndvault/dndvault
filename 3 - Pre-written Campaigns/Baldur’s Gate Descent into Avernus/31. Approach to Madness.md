# 31. Approach to Madness

The Far Realm has twisted these rooms, causing the lines where floor, walls, ceiling, and pillars meet to appear warped.

#### 31a. Warped Foyer

This chamber is lined with twisted columns that seem to change shape slightly every few minutes.

#### 31b. Threshold of Insanity

>**Far Realm Proximity**. A strange energy can be felt emanating from the double door to the west. The closer a creature comes to the doors, the more uneasy it feels.
>
>**Slaadi**. Four invisible **death slaadi** stand in front of the double door leading to area 32. The slaadi serve at the pleasure of Dezmyr and Zalthar, and they attack intruders on sight.
>
>**Tapestry**. A tapestry on the east wall depicts a group of humans twisting, warping, and melting into one amorphous, blasphemous entity.

***Treasure.*** The tapestry weighs 50 pounds and is worth 750 gp to one who appreciates such horrid decor.

>**Ceiling**. This room has a 30-foot-high vaulted ceiling.
>
>**Statues**. Four statues, each one carved to look like a 20-foot-high purple worm bursting up through the floor, fill the corners of the room. (These statues are harmless.)
>
>**Dome**. A deep, 20-foot-high alcove in the north wall contains four **invisible stalkers** trapped inside an invisible, dome-shaped wall of force rising from the floor. (Any items that Halaster removed from the mine carts in level 15, area 1, lie on the floor inside the dome. The dome appears to contain nothing else.)

The dotted circle on map 23 marks the edge of the dome, which was created by a *wall of force* spell made permanent by Halaster. The dome can't be dispelled by *dispel magic*, but a *disintegrate* spell destroys it, freeing the invisible stalkers within.

The invisible stalkers attack any creature other than Halaster that enters the dome using magic (such as a *dimension door* or *misty step* spell). They also attack if the dome is destroyed. The stalkers like to gang up on one opponent at a time.

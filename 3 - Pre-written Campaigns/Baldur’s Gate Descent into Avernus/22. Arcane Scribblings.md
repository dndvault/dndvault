# 22. Arcane Scribblings

>**Chalkboards**. Mounted on the walls are several blackboards on which arcane phrases and formulas are written in chalk.
>
>**Table Trap**. A wooden table in the middle of the room bears a collection of dusty flasks and beakers. The table is draped in cobwebs and obviously hasn't been disturbed in a long time. The paraphernalia is meant to distract viewers from the polymorph trap upon which the table rests (see "Polymorph Traps").

The chalk scribblings were left by one of **Arcturia**'s failed apprentices. Any character who studies the markings and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check can tell that they are attempts by one individual to unravel the secrets of spells beyond their comprehension. Spellcasters who have the *disintegrate* and *flesh to stone* spells on their spell lists can tell that those are the spells being researched, though neither spell can be learned from these incomplete scribblings.

Sounds of battle in this room can be heard by the hobgoblin guards in area 25, who investigate if alerted. (They approach from the east.)

>**Unseen Servants**. Six **living unseen servants** (see *appendix A*) are gathered around two wooden tables, where they are using mortars and pestles to grind dead beetles into ink, and wooden frames and stone scrapers to stretch and scrape leather to create sheets of parchment. The servants ignore visitors.
>
>**Shelves**. Standing against the walls are wooden shelves lined with jars of ink and rolled sheets of blank parchment.

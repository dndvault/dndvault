#### Dragon's Vision

In this vision, the character is camped in a jungle with a handsome nobleman (Lord Vanrak Moonstar). The character hands the knight a polished coral ring as a token of their enduring friendship. Putting the ring on his hand, the nobleman smiles and says, "I will treasure this gift forever." With that, the vision ends.

***Treasure.*** The first character to receive this vision steps on a ring lying on the floor. Close examination reveals that the ring is the one from the dragon's vision: a polished coral band that glimmers with a rainbow of color. The ring is nonmagical and worth 250 gp.

#### Arch Gate to Level 6

The stone arch is one of Halaster's magic gates (see "Gates"). Its rules are as follows:

- If a *silence* spell is cast so that the arch falls within the spell's area, the gate opens for 1 minute.
- Characters must be 9th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes").
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 47a on level 6, in the closest unoccupied space next to the identical gate located there.

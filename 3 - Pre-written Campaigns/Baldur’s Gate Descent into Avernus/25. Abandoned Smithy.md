# 25. Abandoned Smithy

Characters who listen at the doors to these rooms can easily hear the clanging of hammers striking metal, even though the forge was destroyed and abandoned long ago. The sounds are illusory effects created by the Mad Mage (see "Halaster's Lair") that end when any door to the smithy is opened.

#### 25a. Empty Storage Room

Raw metal was stored here until it could be cast into weapons and armor. Now, the room has been mostly cleared out, and the door that leads to area 25b has been smashed to rubble.

What looks like a large iron book lies facedown on the floor in the northeast corner. Closer inspection reveals that the object is a cast-iron mold for smelting metal ingots. The hinged covers form the top and bottom halves of an ingot mold last used by duergar long ago. One side of the mold bears the image of a dwarf's head in profile, the other an image of a mind flayer's skull.

#### 25b. Destroyed Forge

This room contains a rusty iron anvil and the shattered remains of a stone forge, cold and dark for centuries. Bare iron hooks line the walls, the floor is strewn with rubble, and the door to area 25a has been smashed.

If you haven't done so in a while, remind the players that their characters can't shake the feeling that they're being observed (one of Netherskull's regional effects).

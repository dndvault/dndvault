# 7. Anti-Illithid Defense

Two crystal golems (see "Crystal Golems") guard this room. They attack any creature that enters this area unescorted by a githyanki, a **crystal golem**, or a red dragon. If combat breaks out in this chamber, the githyanki warriors in area 6a come to investigate.

A permanent enchantment in this chamber grants any creature in the area advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and causes the *levitate* and *detect thoughts* spells to automatically fail when cast.

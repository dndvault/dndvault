#### Dragon's Vision

In this vision, the character is in a great hall buttressed by six columns (area 32), looming above six blindfolded adventurers bound to the columns with rope. A hollow voice (that of Lord Vanrak Moonstar) issues a terrible command: "**Umbraxakar**, give these fools the death they deserve!" A cone of necrotic energy erupts from the character as the shadow dragon engulfs the nearest prisoner, a male dwarf stripped of gear, with its breath weapon. As the dwarf shrivels and dies, an undead shadow rises from his corpse, and the vision ends.

#### Treasure

A character who studies the gem-encrusted gold horn and succeeds on a DC 25 Intelligence (History) check recognizes it as a one-of-a-kind warning horn entrusted to the royal heir of the Thurumbra clan, a family of shield dwarves thought to have been wiped out by orcs more than a century ago in the distant Sunset Mountains. Dwarf characters have advantage on the check. The horn is worth 2,500 gp as an art object but can be sold for 7,500 gp to a buyer who appreciates its status as a historical relic.

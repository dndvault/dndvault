>**Chalkboard**. A blackboard covers the entire east wall. Written across it in big chalk letters are the words "YOU ALL FAIL!" in Common.
>
>**Desks**. Whenever a creature enters the room, seven stone desks magically rise from the floor, facing the blackboard in an arc. (The desks sink back into the floor when all creatures leave the room.)
>
>**Secret Door**. A secret door in the south wall pushes open to reveal a dusty, web-choked passage between this room and area 25.

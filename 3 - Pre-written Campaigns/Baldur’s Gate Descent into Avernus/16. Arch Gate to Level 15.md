# 16. Arch Gate to Level 15

>**Ceiling**. This chamber soars to a height of 30 feet.
>
>**Arch**. A stone arch set into the south wall is decorated with gold-inlaid images of dragons in flight. Carved into the wall above the arch are the following words in Draconic: "Only a dragon can unlock this gate."
>
>**Fountains**. Alcoves to the west and east contain stone fountains, each carved to look like a perched bronze dragon spouting water into an ornate stone basin.

The fountains are fed by an underground spring and flow with clean, cool water. The living inhabitants of Vanrakdoom depend on this water for their survival.

A fountain's 4-foot-tall dragon sculpture can be broken off with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check and used to activate the arch gate in this room. Each sculpture is a Small object that weighs 500 pounds.

#### Arch Gate

The arch is one of Halaster's gates (see "Gates"). Its rules are as follows:

- The gate opens for 1 minute when a real or illusory dragon touches the arch. An artistic rendering of a dragon, such as a dragon-shaped figurine or a drawing of a dragon, also opens the gate.
- Characters must be 13th level or higher to pass through this gate (see "Jhesiyra Kestellharp"). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see "Elder Runes").
- A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 30a on level 15, in the closest unoccupied space next to the similar gate located there.

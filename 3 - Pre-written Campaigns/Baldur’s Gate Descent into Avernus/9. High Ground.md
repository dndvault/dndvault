# 9. High Ground

This 30-foot-high cavern contains two 10-foot ledges—a smaller one to the west and a bigger one to the south. Five **gargoyles** perch on the north ledge. When the gargoyles detect intruders, one of them flies north to warn the dao (in area 11) that visitors have arrived. If this gargoyle is wounded or waylaid, all the gargoyles attack. Otherwise, the gargoyles that remain speak to visitors in Terran, welcoming them to the "magnificent subterranean domain of Jarûk the dao." They hurl mean insults at the characters if they don't seem to comprehend what the gargoyles are saying.

#### Treasure

A gargoyle that dies but isn't disintegrated outright falls to stony pieces, revealing a fist-sized, transparent red garnet (500 gp) where its heart used to be.

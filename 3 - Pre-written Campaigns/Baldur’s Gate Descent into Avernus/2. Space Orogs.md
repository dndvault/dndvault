# 2. Space Orogs

>**Eyes**. The 15-foot-high ceiling of this passage is carved with hundreds of glaring eyes. (Halaster used magic to create the eyes, which are harmless.)
>
>**Orogs**. Twelve hostile **orogs** (see "Space Orogs") are camped here. Subtract from this number any orogs previously encountered and defeated as wandering monsters.
>
>One of the orogs has 60 hit points and is bigger than the others. Her name is Rukha, and until recently she served as first mate aboard the *Scavenger* (see area 13).

#### Treasure

Rukha the orog has a *sending stone* tucked in one of her gauntlets. Rukha's mate, the former cook of the *Scavenger*, had the matching stone but lost it (see area 13c).

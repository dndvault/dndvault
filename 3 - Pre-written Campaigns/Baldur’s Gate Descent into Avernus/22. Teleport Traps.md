# 22. Teleport Traps

These tunnels contain two teleport traps (see "Teleport Traps").

#### 22a. West Teleport Trap

A creature teleported by this trap arrives at a location determined by rolling a d20 and consulting the following table:

|  d20  | Teleport Destination         |
|:-----:|------------------------------|
|  1–10 | The teleport trap in area 26 |
| 11–20 | The teleport trap in area 28 |

***Additional Effect: Vergadain Lives.*** When a creature is teleported by this trap, a disembodied voice shouts, "Teleported!" at the same moment the **stone golem** in area 23 animates. This golem begins stalking through nearby tunnels, attacking all other creatures it sees. If it finds nothing to attack after prowling these tunnels for 10 minutes, it returns to its alcove and goes dormant.

#### 22b. East Teleport Trap

A creature teleported by this trap arrives at a location determined by rolling a d20 and consulting the following table:

|  d20  | Teleport Destination        |
|:-----:|-----------------------------|
|  1–10 | The teleport trap in area 6 |
| 11–20 | The teleport trap in area 8 |

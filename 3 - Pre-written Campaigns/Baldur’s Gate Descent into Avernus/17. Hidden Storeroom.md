# 17. Hidden Storeroom

This chamber is hidden behind secret doors and choked with dust and cobwebs. It has the following features:

>**Casks**. Five heavy carrying-casks (barrels 3 feet long and 2 feet in diameter with sturdy rope handles) are stacked in the middle of the room. The ale inside them turned to vinegar and evaporated long ago.
>
>**Crate**. Next to the casks is a brittle crate containing sixty-six small brass oil lamps shaped like dragon heads with open, smiling jaws. Each lamp has a wick, but there's no oil to be found.
>
>**Stool**. A three-legged stool lies on its side in the northeast corner. The bones of a dead stirge are nearby.

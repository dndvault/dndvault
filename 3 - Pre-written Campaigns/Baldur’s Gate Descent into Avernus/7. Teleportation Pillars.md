# 7. Teleportation Pillars

Eight black marble pillars form a circle in this 20-foot-high room. Carved into each pillar is a symbol representing one of the eight schools of magic (Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation).

The first time a character enters the circle of pillars, a *magic mouth* spell activates on the floor and speaks the following riddle in Common before vanishing:

A crown festooned my dwarven brow.

I rest beneath the mountain now.

Who am I?

The answer is "Melair," the dwarf king who is buried on *level 6*. The characters can use divination magic to determine the correct answer if they can't work it out.

Speaking Melair's name aloud while standing in the room causes the symbols on the pillars to glow bright colors. The symbols continue to glow for 1 minute. During that time, any creature that enters the area inside the pillars or starts its turn there is teleported to a similar location in area 8, along with anything it is wearing or carrying.

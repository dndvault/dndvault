# 30. Path to the Tomb

Keresta uses this hallway to reach her tomb.

#### 30a. Secret Door

A bas-relief mural covers the southwest wall of this 20-foot-high room. The mural depicts Shar in the form of a young woman, her billowing cloak becoming one with the night sky as she descends upon unsuspecting human mourners in a graveyard. In each hand, she clutches a dagger. Characters who examine the mural closely and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notice four 1-inch-diameter holes bored into the gravestones. Keresta uses these holes to pass through the wall in mist form.

***Secret Door.*** The entire southwest wall is a stone secret door that pivots on a central axis. The secret door is locked but can be opened with a *knock* spell or similar magic. It can also be forced open with a successful DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### 30b. Hidden Hallway

This dusty, 20-foot-high corridor is hidden behind two large secret doors. Rusty chains and manacles hang on the walls at 10-foot intervals.

# 8. Scintilmorn's Rest

>**Fog**. The room is lightly obscured by fog.

>**Vision and Hilt**. Any character who moves more than halfway into the room experiences one of the shadow dragon's fleeting visions and notices the shiny hilt of a longsword lying on the fog-shrouded floor (see "Treasure" below).

#### Dragon's Vision

In this vision, the character confronts a man in a mithral chain shirt (Lord Vanrak Moonstar). The man's eyes brim with madness as he levels a longsword with a radiant blade at the character and screams, "What have we to fear from darkness, you and I? Undermountain is where we belong. It calls to usâ€”can't you hear it?" Waving the sword in the air like a lunatic, he continues, "Together we shall see the Moonstar name elevated to glorious heights my father could never dream of! Waterdeep will shudder at the very sound of it!" With that, the vision ends.

#### Treasure

The hilt lying on the floor is carved to resemble a bronze dragon with its wings spread and its mouth agape. This device is a *sun blade* that has held many names over the years, including Sunlight's Wrath and Shar's Bane. A *legend lore* spell reveals its true name (Scintilmorn) and its original purpose: to destroy vampires and other creatures of the night.

***Umbraxakar's Projection.*** If the hilt of the *sun blade* is picked up, **Umbraxakar**'s smoky projection forms in the middle of the room (see "Visions of Umbraxakar"). It can't leave the area.

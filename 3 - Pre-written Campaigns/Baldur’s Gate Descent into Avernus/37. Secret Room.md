# 37. Secret Room

This unlit chamber connects areas area 30a and area 38c by way of secret doors. The secret doors are readily identifiable and easily opened from inside the room.

#### Xunderbrok

If the word "xunderbrok" is spoken aloud anywhere in this room, a granite cone magically appears on the floor in the southernmost corner of the room. (See level 6, area 39c, for the significance of this word.) The cone is 4 feet tall and 2 feet wide at the base. Close examination reveals that the top of the cone unscrews to reveal a hollow compartment under the cap.

***Treasure.*** The cone's compartment contains a *potion of giant strength* (cloud) in a stoppered, J-shaped crystal flask worth 25 gp.

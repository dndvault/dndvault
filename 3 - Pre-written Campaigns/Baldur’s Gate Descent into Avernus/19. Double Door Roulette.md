# 19. Double Door Roulette

>**Double Doors**. Seven sets of double doors, six of them at the end of short hallways, stand closed.

>**Scintillating Pillar**. A pillar at the center of the 20-foot-high room has deep notches cut into it, which pulse with a shifting rainbow of light.

Behind most of the double doors are blank stone walls. Only the southern set of doors holds a path forward: pulling open these doors reveals area 22 beyond. Creatures that pass through the doorway get no sense that they're leaving Undermountain and entering Halaster's extradimensional tower.

Whenever a double door in this area is opened—except the one to the south (see above)—the pillar emits colored rays from its myriad notches, duplicating the effect of a *prismatic spray* spell (save DC 22) that targets all creatures within 60 feet of the pillar. Any creature that would be transported to another plane by this effect instead appears in the arms of the Halaster statue in area 22.

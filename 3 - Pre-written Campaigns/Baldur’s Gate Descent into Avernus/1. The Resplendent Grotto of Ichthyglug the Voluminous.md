# 1. The Resplendent Grotto of Ichthyglug the Voluminous

Halaster has used his magic to tailor these caves to the satisfaction of Ichthyglug the marid.

#### 1a. Shipwreck

This 50-foot-high cavern contains the wreck of a cog (a 54-foot-long cargo vessel with a single mast). The wreck's features are as follows:

>**Hull**. The ship has broken in half, the shattered bow aiming northward and the aft section leaning against the east wall. The oak hull is soft and waterlogged, as though the vessel has been underwater for years, and both halves are encrusted with barnacles.
>
>**Mast and Anchor**. The mast and anchor have broken off and lie in the middle of the cave, with the mast pointing toward a shimmering curtain of water to the west.
>
>**No Sails, No Rigging, No Crew**. The ship's square sail, rigging, and crew are all missing. (The sail and the rigging disintegrated long ago.)
>

Characters who search the wreck discover its name carved over the barnacle-encrusted rudder: the *Blue Opal*. A character who learns the ship's name and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (History) check recalls that the *Blue Opal* sank in Waterdeep's harbor a few years ago under mysterious circumstances, and that the crew was rescued by merfolk who live in the harbor. Armed with this knowledge, a character can examine the hull for signs of foul play and, with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, discover a square, smooth-cut hole in the aft section below what would have been the water line. A successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check confirms that a *disintegrate* spell made the square hole, but there's no way to know who cast the spell or why the ship was sunk.

If more than one character enters the aft section at the same time, the partial hull shifts under the added weight, topples to one side, and collapses in on itself with a thunderous racket. Any creature inside the aft section when it collapses must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage from falling debris on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The watery curtains in area 1b prevent the sound of the collapse from reaching area 1c.

#### 1b. Curtains of Water

This passage has a 20-foot-high, arched ceiling and contains three 1-foot-thick, magic curtains of translucent, shimmering green seawater. Each watery curtain stretches from floor to ceiling and wall to wall. Sound passing through a curtain is greatly reduced; only creatures within 5 feet of it can hear anything from the other side.

Any object thrown or shot through a watery curtain has a cost of 60 feet immediately applied to its distance traveled. If this added distance changes a ranged weapon attack from normal to long range, the attack roll is made with disadvantage. An object that enters the curtain and can travel no farther falls to the floor inside the curtain.

Spell effects that would not reasonably pass through the watery curtain are stopped by the barrier as though it were a solid wall. For example, a *magic missile* spell could pass through the curtain to hit creatures on the far side of it, but the explosion from a *fireball* spell would not get through the barrier.

A creature that passes through a watery curtain gets drenched but suffers no other ill effects. In addition, lit torches and other open flames of a nonmagical nature are doused as they pass through the water. Any creature that takes damage from water, such as a fire elemental, takes 11 (2d10) cold damage when it starts its turn in a watery curtain or enters it for the first time on a turn.

If a watery curtain takes 50 cold damage or more from a single source, it becomes a 1-foot-thick wall of ice (as if created by a *wall of ice* spell) for 10 minutes before reverting to its original form. A watery curtain targeted by a successful *dispel magic* spell (DC 17) is destroyed for good.

#### 1c. Ichthyglug's Cavern

>**Music**. Magical harp music fills this 30-foot-high cavern.
>
>**Pool**. A 15-foot-deep freshwater pool is home to a **marid** and six **swarms of quippers**.
>
>**Walls**. The damp walls have harmless snails and giant starfish clinging to them.

The marid, Ichthyglug, is swimming in his pool when the characters first arrive. He greets them with a song (see the "Ichthyglug's Song" sidebar). As he sings, Ichthyglug uses his magic to cause fountains of water to erupt from the pool as quippers leap out of the water around him. Ichthyglug is neither good nor evil, but always unpredictable. His attitude toward the characters reflects their attitude toward him.

After concluding his song, Ichthyglug floats up to characters who seem receptive and gives them the opportunity to flatter his singing. After these pleasantries, he offers the characters a quest: destroy the lich **Ezzat** on *level 20* and give the lich's phylactery to Ichthyglug. The marid promises fabulous treasure in exchange, even going so far as to mention that he is forced by Halaster's magic to make good on this promise (see "Treasure" below).

If the characters complete Ichthyglug's quest and give **Ezzat**'s phylactery to the marid, the pool in this cavern turns into a vortex that draws Ichthyglug, the water, the quippers, and the lich's phylactery back to the Elemental Plane of Water. The characters find Ichthyglug's promised reward at the bottom of the drained pool. Characters who complete Ichthyglug's quest should receive XP as if they had defeated the marid and the swarms of quippers in combat.

If the characters destroy **Ezzat** but give the lich's phylactery to Jar√ªk the dao in area 11b, Ichthyglug knows this. Furious, he attacks the characters the next time he sees them.

Ichthyglug can't leave his cave without **Ezzat**'s phylactery. If the marid dies here, his body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam, only to re-form 24 hours later. (The characters don't receive XP for killing Ichthyglug more than once.)

The marid commands the quippers to attack anyone who dares to enter his pool. The swarms pose no danger to creatures on land.

***Treasure.*** Ichthyglug wears a pair of golden bracers shaped like octopi (250 gp each) and a large silk vest studded with ten blue spinels (500 gp each). These baubles vanish with the marid when he returns to the Elemental Plane of Water.

Ichthyglug's reward consists of a suit of *mariner's armor* (scale mail) and two common wondrous items: a *candle of the deep* and a *pole of angling* (both described below). These items appear only after the characters complete Ichthyglug's quest and help the marid escape from Undermountain.

The flame of the *candle of the deep* is not extinguished when immersed in water. It gives off light and heat like a normal candle.

The *pole of angling* looks like a 10-foot pole. While holding the pole, one can speak the command word ("Ichthyglug") and transform it into a fishing pole with a hook, a line, and a reel. Speaking the command word again changes the fishing pole back into a normal 10-foot pole.

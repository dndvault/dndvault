# 13. Walking Dead

>**Zombie**. A human **zombie** in rotting, soiled robes shuffles back and forth through the room. A powerful stench of decay accompanies it.
>
>**Furnishings**. Moldy furnishings include a bed, a desk strewn with yellowed papers, and a barren bookshelf.

The zombie is what remains of Zail Ephram, a human wizard and adventurer who was killed in Shadowdusk Hold. **Melissara Shadowdusk** (see area 10a) used an *animate dead* spell to animate the wizard's corpse. The zombie has nothing of value and attacks any creature that disturbs it other than its creator.

The papers on the desk are architectural drawings. Characters who spend 1 hour studying the drawings can piece together accurate maps of tiers 1 and 2 of Shadowdusk Hold, except for secret doors and areas hidden behind them.

# 16. Spectral Bridge

A 120-foot-long, 10-foot-wide bridge of wispy magical energy spans the lava-filled chasm, connecting areas 9 and 17. This bridge provides a relatively safe means of crossing the chasm, particularly given that the chasm suppresses *fly* spells and similar magic (see area 40).

The bridge, suspended 30 feet above the surface of the lava, is flat, translucent, and without railings. Normally, it is solid and safe to walk onâ€”but any section of the bridge within 10 feet of a magic item becomes insubstantial. A creature or object passes through an insubstantial section of the bridge like it's not there. A successful *dispel magic* spell cast on the bridge (DC 18) causes the entire span to disappear for 1 hour.

In order to retain their magic items as they cross the bridge, the characters must devise a way to distance the items from the bridge as they cross it, such as by tying the items to ropes and dangling them more than 10 feet from the span.

#### Fireball Trap

Whenever a creature on the bridge crosses the midpoint of the span, there is a 25 percent chance that the lava pool below spouts a fireball that explodes at a point centered on that creature. The effect is that of a *fireball* spell (save DC 19) cast using a 7th-level spell slot. It deals 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

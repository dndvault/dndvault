# Keresta Delvingstone

**Keresta Delvingstone** grew up in the streets of Waterdeep and is no stranger to hardship. Hoping to make a better life for herself, she became an adventurer and sought fame and fortune in Undermountain. Keresta met her end in the lair of a vampire and became a **vampire spawn** under its command.

After Vanrak destroyed the vampire and conquered its lair, he took Keresta under his wing. Consumed by darkness and loss, Keresta was drawn to Shar like a moth to a flame and rose to become a vampire cleric of the evil god. She now leads Shar's debased cult in Vanrakdoom and intends to send the group on a mission to destroy the Spires of the Morning, the temple of Lathander (god of birth and renewal) in Waterdeep. She also has her sights set on destroying the House of the Moon—Waterdeep's temple of Selûne, whom she blames for the destruction of Vanrak Moonstar.

Keresta is a **vampire**, with these changes:

- Keresta summons **giant centipedes** instead of wolves.
- She gains the Spellcasting feature described below.

***Spellcasting.*** Keresta is a 9th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following cleric spells prepared:

- Cantrips (at will): *guidance*, *mending*, *resistance*, *thaumaturgy*
- 1st level (4 slots): *bane*, *command*, *inflict wounds*, *ray of sickness*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *blindness/deafness*, *ray of enfeeblement*, *spiritual weapon*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *animate dead*, *bestow curse*, *dispel magic*, *spirit guardians*
- 4th level (3 slots): *blight*, *death ward*, *divination*
- 5th level (1 slot): *antilife shell*, *destructive wave*

#### Regional Effects

Vanrakdoom is Keresta's lair, and the following regional effects are noticeable throughout it:

- Fog creeps into areas of dim light or darkness. It vanishes when light is brought to bear on it but reappears when the light passes. A permanent fog hangs in some areas regardless of light, as noted in the descriptions of those areas.
- Rats and bats are plentiful. In areas where they are not specifically mentioned, droppings and guano betray their presence, and they can be heard constantly scuttling and shrieking in the distant darkness.

If Keresta is destroyed, the fog disperses, and the rats and bats gradually die off until only a scattered few remain.

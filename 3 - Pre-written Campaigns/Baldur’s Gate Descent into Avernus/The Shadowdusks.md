# The Shadowdusks

The Shadowdusk family, like many other Waterdavian noble lineages, made its fortune in trading. Three sisters named Arandraya, Maelweene, and Yarlithra Shadowdusk became famous for sponsoring and then leading adventuring expeditions into Undermountain. One of the items they recovered from the dungeon was a tablet of black crystal that allowed contact with entities of the Far Realm. Their brother, Xerrion, came to possess the tablet and used it to contact otherworldly beings in an attempt to destroy his family's business rivals and political enemies. This contact drove Xerrion mad, and it didn't take long for the madness to spread to other members of the Shadowdusk family and come into public view. As the family's behavior grew more bizarre, local broadsheets circulated rumors that the Shadowdusks had been replaced by aberrant horrors in human guise. Their ancestral villa, Shadowdusk Hold, was burned to the ground in the Year of the Harp (1355 DR). The Waterdavian authorities who investigated the blaze never made their findings public, but the commonly held belief is that the city's Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors was responsible.

All three of Xerrion's sisters were killed in the fire that consumed Shadowdusk Hold. Xerrion escaped and fled to his sisters' redoubt in the depths of Undermountain. From there, he used *sending* spells to contact Shadowdusk family members living abroad and brought them to live with him in a twisted, underground version of Shadowdusk Hold. Among those who answered the call was Margaraste Shadowdusk, a distant cousin whom Xerrion would later marry.

Level 22 of Undermountain became a safe haven where the Shadowdusks could treat with Far Realm horrors away from the prying eyes of their fellow Waterdavians. In the end, Xerrion and Margaraste stepped through a gateway into the Far Realm and were never seen again. In their absence, the torch of leadership passed to Xerrion's niece and nephew, Dezmyr and Zalthar—the twin children of his late sister Yarlithra. These former paladins of Torm abandoned their faith long ago, becoming death knights.

Over the years, **Halaster Blackcloak** has kept his eye on the Shadowdusks and their plots, even as he allows the family free rein in their corner of his domain. The Mad Mage has decided that these are the kinds of nobles that need to be making decisions and wielding power in Waterdeep—so that he can secretly rule the city using them as puppets. As such, he encourages the Shadowdusks to consolidate power in preparation for a triumphant and bloody return to Waterdeep, after which Halaster will seize power as the city's Shadow Lord.

The Shadowdusk family motto used to be "No secrets without truth." After the family's fall, its motto changed to "We do not fear the darkness." The family's crest is a lit torch with three embers rising from the flame, set against a purple background. In the wake of the family's descent into Undermountain and madness, this crest has been literally turned upside down, so that the torch flame points downward.

#### Dezmyr and Zalthar

The current leaders of Shadowdusk Hold are the twins **Dezmyr** and **Zalthar Shadowdusk**. They have remained close throughout life and undeath, and might have led their mortal family skillfully if circumstances had played out differently.

The twins are devoted to each other and are obsessed with returning their family to prominence and ultimately seizing control of Waterdeep.

# 37. Harmless Halaster Statue

This cavern has a jagged, 20-foot-high ceiling. The floor is smooth and level except for a sloping tunnel that descends to *level 16*.

In the middle of the cave stands a life-size statue of Halaster with lidless eyes carved into its flowing robe. The statue is a Medium object with AC 17, 45 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A character can topple the statue with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

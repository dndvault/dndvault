# 32. Death's Head Barracks

Hobgoblin forces are quartered in these rooms, which are engulfed in a permanent antimagic field similar to that created by an *antimagic field* spell (the result of a magical experiment gone awry).

#### 32a. Soldiers' Quarters

Thirty **hobgoblins** rest in wooden bunk beds stacked three tiers high. There are enough beds to accommodate sixty guards. The hobgoblins sleep in their armor; their weapons and shields hang from hooks on the corners of their bunks.

#### 32b. Guard Post

Four **hobgoblins** stand guard hereâ€”two flanking the door to area 32a, and two flanking the door to area 32c. Any battle here brings reinforcements from those areas, as well as from area 20.

#### 32c. Captains' Quarters

Two **hobgoblin captains** converse quietly in this room, which contains three beds. Other furnishings include a stone table surrounded by six wooden stools, with an unlit iron chandelier suspended above it.

The captains are worried about the recent abnormal behavior of their warlord commander (see area 33) and contemplating what to do about it. So far, the captains have hidden Doomcrown's bizarre preoccupations from the rest of the hobgoblin legion and remain, for the time being, loyal subordinates.

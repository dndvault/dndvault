#### Dragon's Vision

In this vision, the character is in the presence of Vanrak Moonstar, a death knight wearing a mithral chain shirt and clutching a bladeless sword hilt. "This is not the fate either of us deserved," he says mournfully. "In darkness, we have lost our way." With that, he causes a blade of light to spring from the sword hilt and drives it down his own throat, reducing his skeletal form to dust. The blade is snuffed out, and all goes dark as the hilt clatters to the floor alongside the death knight's mithral chain shirt. The vision ends with a dragon's anguished roar.

# Red Dragons

**Ashtyrranthor**, an adult red dragon, is mother to six young red dragons that live in the Crystal Labyrinth and defend CrÃ¨che K'liir. **Ashtyrranthor**'s children are named Ashranthax, Blazutranc, Infernexus, Meteoranzym, Smoakcant, and Zolcharrx.

#### Astyrranthor

**Ashtyrranthor** can't treat Stardock as her lair, so she has no lair actions here. However, she has the following Innate Spellcasting trait:

***Innate Spellcasting.*** **Ashtyrranthor**'s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

1/day each: *alarm*, *detect magic*, *gaseous form*, *misty step*, *passwall*, *see invisibility*

**Ashtyrranthor** spends most of her time on the outer surface of the asteroid, prowling through the wreckage of spacefaring vessels that crashed into Stardock long ago. If combat breaks out inside CrÃ¨che K'liir, there is a 10 percent chance that she hears the disturbance. She investigates immediately, joining the battle in progress and using her *gaseous form*, *misty step*, and *passwall* spells to enter hard-to-reach locations. **Ashtyrranthor** also keeps a specific watch over areas 12f, area 13, and area 16a from outside the asteroid. If she sees trouble or intruders in those areas, she attacks at once.

> ##### Crystal Golems
>
>Crystal golems found throughout the Crystal Labyrinth look like 10-foot-tall githyanki warriors. They understand Gith but can't speak, and they attack any creatures that don't look like githyanki or red dragons. Each **crystal golem** is a stone golem with these additional traits:
>
>***Illumination.*** The golem magically sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light goes out when the golem is destroyed.

>***Light Intensity.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the illuminated golem and can see the golem must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the start of the creature's next turn.

>A creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the golem until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the golem in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

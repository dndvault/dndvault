#### Treasure

A search of the stacks turns up four profoundly philosophical texts worth 250 gp each to an interested sage. Their titles are *Patterns in the Tapestry of Time*, *The U'keth Prophecies*, *Whispers of a Bygone Truth*, and *Tales of Existential Dread*.

The tapestry features a stunning night sky set with pearls and diamond chips as stars, but the constellations match none known in Faer√ªn. The tapestry is worth 2,500 gp and weighs 30 pounds.

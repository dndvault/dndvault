>**Tapestries**. Shredded tapestries that once depicted coastal scenes lie in heaps near the walls. Disturbing the tapestries causes a harmless, smoky projection of **Umbraxakar** to appear in the middle of the room. It rushes toward intruders, hoping to scare them away.

#### Dragon's Vision

In this vision, the character is standing before a cloaked nobleman (Lord Vanrak Moonstar) on a windy cliff overlooking the sea. The noble asks the character to join him on a dangerous quest into the Black Jungles. Putting a hand on the character's shoulder, the man asks, "We are the best of friends, **Glyster**, are we not?" With that, the vision ends.

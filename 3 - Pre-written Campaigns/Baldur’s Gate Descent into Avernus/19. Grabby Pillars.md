# 19. Grabby Pillars

>**Ropers**. Three **ropers** are disguised as 10-foot-tall pillars of rough-hewn stone that extend from floor to ceiling. Lying on the floor between the pillars is a key of bone. Set into each pillar at a height of 7 feet is a lidded eye fixed on the key. (These are the ropers' actual eyes, which appear still and lifeless.)
>
>**Frescoes**. The walls are covered with faded frescoes that depict Underdark caverns and fungi forests.
>
>**Teleport Trap**. A teleport trap (see "Teleport Traps") fills the space marked on the map.

The 6-inch-long key is carved from a dragon's finger bone, and its yellow head is shaped like an H. This key unlocks the doors to area 39c. A similar key can be found in area 30b.

The ropers remain still and hold their pillar-like shapes until the key is disturbed or until one or more of the ropers is attacked or poked in the eye, whereupon all three sprout tendrils and attack all other creatures in the room. The ropers ignore intruders otherwise, since Halaster keeps them well fed.

#### Teleport Trap

A creature teleported by this room's teleport trap arrives at a location determined by rolling a d20 and consulting the following table:

# 20. Pillared Hall

Stone pillars support the flat, 40-foot-high ceiling. Every sound here is amplified, such that even a whispered voice or soft footstep can be heard throughout areas 20a, 20b, and 20c. Dexterity (Stealth) checks to move silently through the area are made with disadvantage.

#### 20a. Central Chamber

>**Guards**. Five invisible **will-o'-wisps** patrol this area.
>
>**Dais**. Five steps lead to the top of a stone dais, at the back of which is a set of gold-plated double doors that open into area 22.
>

If visitors arrive unannounced, the **will-o'-wisps** become visible and impatiently question the new arrivals. Characters must present a plausible reason for their presence and succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check to convince the **will-o'-wisps** not to attack them. If they don't like what they hear, three of the wisps attack. The other two break away to warn Vertrand (area 17) and Berlain (area 18b), who, along with Berlain's grell valets, converge on this area. If a battle erupts here, the nothics in area 20b join the fray.

#### 20b. West Atrium

Five **nothics** hide behind the pillars in this area. They fight alongside the **will-o'-wisps** in area 20a but avoid combat otherwise. If the characters attack the nothics, any **will-o'-wisps** in area 20a come to the nothics' aid.

#### 20c. East Atrium

This side chamber is unoccupied.

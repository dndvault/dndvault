# 18. Animated Hallway

This 250-foot-long, downward-sloping hallway has been set into permanent animated motion by Halaster's magic. It twists and undulates continuously, making it tricky to negotiate. Any creature that enters the corridor or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage as it is knocked about. If the creature is standing, walking, or running on the floor, the ceiling, or a wall when it fails this saving throw, it tumbles 20 feet down the tunnel before landing prone. A flying creature has advantage on the saving throw and doesn't tumble or fall prone if it fails the save.

# 16. Death's Head Looters

>**Sarcophagi**. Three dusty stone sarcophagi lie in a row in the middle of the room. Their flat stone lids have been pried off and cast aside.
>
>**Hobgoblins**. Unless they have been drawn elsewhere, six **hobgoblins** are rummaging through the sarcophagi.
>
>**Secret Door**. A secret door in the north wall opens into area 17. (The hobgoblins are unaware of the door.)

The hobgoblins, searching aimlessly for anything valuable, gang up on foes to quickly take them down.

Each sarcophagus contains the desiccated corpses of 1d3 humanoids in scorched robes, lying atop the dust of the ancient dead. The corpses are those of **Arcturia**'s past apprentices and assistants, each of whom displeased her in some way and paid the ultimate price.

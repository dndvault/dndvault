# Cult of Shar

The cult of Shar in Vanrakdoom consists mainly of **vampire spawn** under the command of **Keresta Delvingstone**. Living cultists also find their way here from time to time, guided through Undermountain by the dark grace of Shar herself. Keresta turns the most promising acolytes into vampire spawn. Those deemed unworthy of Shar's blessing nourish Keresta and her spawn with their blood, after which **Umbraxakar** devours the exsanguinated corpses.

Cultists are neutral evil humans who wear dusty gray robes over their armor. These robes bear the symbol of Shar: a black circle bordered in dark purple.

# 38. Zombie Horde

>**Zombies**. The stench of death fills this 20-foot-high cavern, which contains forty **zombies** in various states of decay. They shamble about aimlessly.

>**Sinkhole**. A 70-foot-deep sinkhole has formed near the east wall.

The zombies are the remains of humanoids killed by Netherskull and animated by its Negative Energy Cone. They include several humans and dwarves, as well as a few elves, drow, tieflings, quaggoths, duergar, hobgoblins, troglodytes, and githyanki. Until Netherskull summons them, the zombies remain here and attack intruders on sight. You can expedite combat by dividing the zombies into mobs of ten or fewer and using the mob rules in *chapter 8* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

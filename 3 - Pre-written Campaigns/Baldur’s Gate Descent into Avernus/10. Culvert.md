# 10. Culvert

The normally sluggish river of ooze flows a bit faster as it approaches a natural, 10-foot-diameter culvert in the north wall. Any creature in the ooze that ends its turn in the culvert must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be irresistibly pulled under. Unless the creature is tethered to something, it drowns in ooze as it is borne deep into the Underdark.

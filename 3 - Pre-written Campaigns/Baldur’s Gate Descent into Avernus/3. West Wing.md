# 3. West Wing

Four **nothics** lurk in the northern arm of this L-shaped gallery, poring over wall carvings and chattering to themselves. Beyond the nothics, a staircase descends 50 feet to tier 2.

The nothics are puzzled by the carvings, which depict various deceased members of the Shadowdusk family. They attack intruders on sight.

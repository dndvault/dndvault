# 26. Apprentice's Quarters

Like her former master Halaster, **Arcturia** takes on apprentices of her own from time to time, but they seldom survive for long. This room contains a moldy quilt draped over a stone bier against the north wall and a wooden desk with a high-backed chair in the southeast corner. On one corner of the desk rests a yellowed human skull topped with a half-melted wax candle.

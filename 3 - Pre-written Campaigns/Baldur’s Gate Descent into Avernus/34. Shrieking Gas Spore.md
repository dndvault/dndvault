# 34. Shrieking Gas Spore

Floating in the middle of this otherwise empty room is a **gas spore** that has the added defense of a shrieker. When bright light or a creature comes within 30 feet of the gas spore, it uses its reaction to emit a shriek audible within 300 feet of it. The gas spore continues to shriek until the disturbance moves out of range and for 1d4 rounds afterward.

The shrieking of the gas spore alerts the hobgoblins in areas 32c and area 33, who come to investigate.

# Githyanki

The militaristic githyanki who live in the Crystal Labyrinth and Stardock have three important tasks: protect the crèche, train young githyanki warriors, and destroy the mind flayer colony in Seadeeps (*level 17*).

#### Knights and the Draconic Tongue

Githyanki knights encountered in the Crystal Labyrinth and Stardock speak Draconic in addition to their native language of Gith—all the better to communicate with their red dragon mounts.

#### Githyanki Leaders

The githyanki are led by **Al'chaia**, a knight who is cruel to her trainees and soldiers. **Al'chaia** recently acquired a *manual of gainful exercise* and a *tome of clear thought*, and she has promised to award both items to her most accomplished soldier. In truth, she plans to read these tomes to gain their benefits herself, but uses the promise of this reward to trick her troops into running themselves ragged. **Al'chaia**'s second in command, Urlon, is tired of the abuse and plots against her.

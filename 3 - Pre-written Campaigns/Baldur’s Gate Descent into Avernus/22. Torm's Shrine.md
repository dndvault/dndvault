# 22. Torm's Shrine

>**Altar and Fresco**. Three steps ascend to an alcove holding a stone altar. The wall behind the altar bears a fresco of a large white gauntlet (the symbol of Torm).
>
>**Statues**. Standing in the "tips" of the crescent-shaped room, flanking the altar, are a pair of life-size stone statues that depict human paladins clad in plate armor. (The statues resemble **Dezmyr** and **Zalthar Shadowdusk** as they appeared when they were alive.)

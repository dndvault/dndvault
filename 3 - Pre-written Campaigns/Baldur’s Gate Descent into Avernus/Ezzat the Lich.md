# Ezzat the Lich

**Ezzat** has become obsessed with destroying Halaster and usurping his control over Undermountain. As his mania and thirst for power grows, the lich becomes more like Halaster with each passing day.

Characters who destroy **Ezzat** and locate his phylactery earn Halaster's favor. Those who ally with the lich earn Halaster's enmity.

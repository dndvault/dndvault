# 11. The Glittering Caverns of Jarûk the Prismatic

These crystal-lined caves are home to a dao and its minions.

#### 11a. Fortune Favors the Boulders

>**Columns and Crystals**. Two columns of rock support the 30-foot-high ceiling of this cave, the walls of which are encrusted with crystals that catch and reflect light.
>
>**Boulders**. The floor is strewn with boulders and rubble. Six **galeb duhr** beholden to Jarûk hide here, disguised as boulders.
>
>**Music**. Dissonant music emanates from a smaller cave to the southeast (area 11b).
>

If the characters attack Jarûk in area 11b, the galeb duhr attack the characters when they return to this cave. Otherwise, the creatures remain motionless and pose no danger. If provoked into attacking, the galeb duhr animate boulders. The galeb duhr and their boulders can pursue prey beyond the confines of this cavern.

#### 11b. Jarûk's Cavern

>**Music**. Rock music fills this 30-foot-high cavern, which resembles the inside of a geode. The walls and ceiling are encrusted with crystals that catch and reflect light.
>
>**Dao in the Sand**. The floor is concave and filled with golden sand to a depth of 10 feet. A **dao** hides in the sand until visitors appear.
>
>**Medusas**. Two **medusas** wearing black robes and veils lurk in the northern alcove.
>

The dao, Jarûk, rises out of the sand when the characters first arrive. He greets them with a song (see the "Jarûk's Song" sidebar). As he sings, the veiled medusas emerge from their alcove and begin to dance around him as the sand swirls and forms little dust devils. Jarûk is evil and cruel, but his current predicament motivates him to be a civil host.

Once his song has ended, Jarûk offers the characters a quest: destroy the lich **Ezzat** on *level 20* and bring him the lich's phylactery. The dao promises treasure in exchange and is forced by Halaster's magic to make good on this promise (see "Treasure" below). If the characters complete Jarûk's quest and give **Ezzat**'s phylactery to the dao, the sandy floor turns into a giant vortex that draws Jarûk, the medusas, the sand, and the lich's phylactery back to the Elemental Plane of Earth. The characters find Jarûk's promised reward on the floor of the emptied cave. Characters who complete Jarûk's quest should receive XP as if they had defeated the dao and the medusas in combat.

If the characters destroy **Ezzat** but give the lich's phylactery to Ichthyglug the marid in area 1c, Jarûk knows this and attacks the characters the next time he sees them.

Jarûk can't leave his cave without **Ezzat**'s phylactery. If the dao dies here, his body disintegrates into crystalline powder, only to re-form 24 hours later. (The characters don't receive XP for killing Jarûk more than once.)

The medusas defend the dao to the best of their ability. Jarûk is immune to their Petrifying Gaze.

***Treasure.*** Jarûk wears a pair of golden hoop earrings studded with obsidian (500 gp for the pair) and an amber diadem (7,500 gp). These baubles vanish with the dao when he returns to the Elemental Plane of Earth.

Jarûk's reward consists of a *gem of brightness* and two common wondrous items: *boots of false tracks* and an *orb of direction* (both described below). These items appear only after the characters complete Jarûk's quest and help him escape from Undermountain.

The wearer of *boots of false tracks* can choose to have the boots leave tracks like those of another kind of humanoid of the wearer's size. Only humanoids can wear these boots.

Someone who holds an *orb of direction* can use an action to determine which way is north. This property functions only on the Material Plane.

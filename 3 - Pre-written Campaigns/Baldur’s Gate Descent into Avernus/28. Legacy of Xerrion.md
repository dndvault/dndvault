# 28. Legacy of Xerrion

Two sets of double doors lead to this hall, and opening either set alerts the creatures on guard here. The hall's contents are as follows:

>**Slaadi**. Four invisible **death slaadi** stand guard next to the northernmost pillars. The slaadi serve at the pleasure of Dezmyr and Zalthar, and they attack intruders on sight.
>
>**Fresco**. Two stone benches arranged side by side in the middle of the hall face a colorful fresco on the north wall. The fresco, 30 feet long by 15 feet tall, depicts a slender, middle-aged human wizard (Xerrion Shadowdusk) standing before a magic portal with tentacles pouring out of it. The wizard is smiling, and clutched in his arms is a black crystal tablet.

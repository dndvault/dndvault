Characters who listen at either door to this room hear strange clicking noises from beyond.

>**Hook Horror**. A **hook horror** is trapped in the room, but there's more to it than meets the eye.

>**Shelves**. The curved walls are lined with stone shelves.
>
>**Smashed Jars**. Hundreds of jars of body parts lie smashed on the floor.

A hobgoblin accidentally set off a polymorph trap and was transformed into this hook horror. The other hobgoblins decided to trap it in this room as a joke. Lacking hands, the hook horror couldn't open the doors to escape, and it swept the bottles off the shelves in a rage, spilling their contents.

When the hook horror drops to 0 hit points, it turns back into an unconscious **hobgoblin** named Jarrk. Despite his recent misadventure, Jarrk is fanatically loyal to Doomcrown and would never willingly betray him.

**Arcturia** collected body parts from all sorts of Underdark specimens. Characters who search through the detritus find moth wings, beetle shells, darkmantle eyes, stirge hooks, flumph tendrils, troglodyte claws, demon ichor, gelatinous residue, and other worthless creepy bits. At your discretion, some useful spell components might lie amid the refuse.

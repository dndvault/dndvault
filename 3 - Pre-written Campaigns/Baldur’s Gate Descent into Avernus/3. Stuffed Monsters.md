# 3. Stuffed Monsters

The secret doors leading to this chamber are 10 feet square. It takes a singular or combined Strength of 16 to push open each door. The room is choked with dust and cobwebs. Five dead creatures stuffed with sawdust and displayed in lifelike poses are crammed into the northern half of the room. The stuffed monsters and their weights are summarized below:

- An aarakocra with wings spread, clutching a javelin (120 pounds)
- A reared-up ankheg (600 pounds)
- A young brass dragon with wings tucked in, head lowered, and jaws agape (750 pounds)
- An ettercap with its arms raised menacingly (200 pounds)
- A hell hound with a *continual flame* spell cast in its gullet (150 pounds)

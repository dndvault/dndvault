>**Fog**. The room is lightly obscured by fog.

>**Statue**. The east corner holds a black marble statue of a cloaked woman wielding two daggers. Three dust-covered human skeletons lie at the statue's feet

>**Robed Figure**. Kneeling before the statue is a humanoid figure in a purple and black robe.

The kneeling figure is an empty robe that collapses into a pile on the floor if it is disturbed or targeted by a *dispel magic* spell.

The skeletons lying at the statue's feet are the remains of long-dead adventurers placed here as a warning not to disturb the 7-foot-tall statue. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check can ascertain that the statue depicts Shar.

# 19. Shadowdusk Hold Fresco

This chamber is empty except for a dusty fresco on the north wall. Measuring 30 feet long by 15 feet tall, it depicts a stately, ivy-covered mansion and estate that once stood in Waterdeepâ€”the original Shadowdusk Hold.

Situated in small niches that form the mansion's windows are tiny, 3-inch-tall painted wooden busts representing members of the Shadowdusk household circa 1355 DR. Characters who have seen other depictions of Arandraya, Maelweene, Yarlithra, and Xerrion Shadowdusk recognize their tiny likenesses alongside the busts of other family members and servants. Two window niches are noticeably empty, because Zalthar has removed the busts within (see area 34a).

# 1. Grand Foyer

The stairs from *level 21* descend to a grand entry chamber that contains the following features:

>**Pillars**. Pillars support the 40-foot-high, vaulted ceiling.
>
>**Grells**. Six **grells** float behind the pillars to the north. The grells attack visitors and can use their tentacles to open and close doors as needed.
>
>**Apparitions**. Spectral images of dead servants and adventurers occasionally fade into view, wander the hall, then fade away. These images are harmless regional effects created by Halaster (see "Halaster's Lair").
>
>**Statues**. Statues depicting two well-dressed humans stand in alcoves to the south.
>

The statues show the Shadowdusk twins, Zalthar and Dezmyr, as they appeared in life. Zalthar's statue is in the west alcove and stands 6 feet 11 inches tall. Dezmyr's statue to the east stands 6 feet 3 inches tall. An inscription on the bottom of each statue identifies its subject.

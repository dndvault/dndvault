# 12. Wheel Room

Hidden behind a secret door is a dusty, 10-foot-high room that contains the following features:

>**Lever**. In the middle of the room, a 6-foot-diameter rusty iron wheel protrudes from the floor.
>
>**Unseen Servant**. Standing silently in the northwest corner is a **living unseen servant** (see *appendix A*).
>

The rusty iron wheel can be rotated a half turn in either direction, squealing loudly until it clicks to a stop. Turning the wheel causes mechanisms under the floor to clank and whir, locking the lids of all the covered pits on this level and deactivating all the teleport traps on this level. Resetting the wheel to its original position reactivates these traps.

The living unseen servant doesn't announce its presence to anyone. If the characters turn the wheel but fail to destroy the unseen servant, it waits until they leave the room before using the wheel to reactivate the traps on this level.

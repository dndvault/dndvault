# 41. Shadowdusk Vault

The Shadowdusks store their family's wealth here. The walls climb 15 feet vertically before angling inward, coming to a point 30 feet above the floor. The room's contents are as follows:

>**Hoard**. Treasure is piled in the middle of the room.
>
>**Statues**. Three statues stand in shallow alcoves. Each depicts a monstrously warped humanoid.
>

Each statue is roughly 6 feet tall and shows a human figure in robes, standing with arms outstretched. Each one has been warped by the power of the Far Realm:

- The western statue has a mass of tentacles where a normal creature's head would be.
- The face of the southern statue has been replaced with a chisel-toothed maw, and its arms resemble oily pseudopods. The head of the eastern statue has begun to flow and melt, but it is still recognizable as Halaster.

#### Treasure

The treasure hoard consists of the following:

- 2,200 pp, 24,800 gp, and 14,000 sp
- Three gemstones amid the coins: a topaz (500 gp), a star ruby (1,000 gp), and a jacinth (5,000 gp)
- A tiny, incandescent blue sphere easily mistaken for a magic gemstone (actually an *Ioun stone of insight*)
- A child's rocking horse, half scorched by fire, with a gold music box (750 gp) tucked in a small compartment under the hinged saddle

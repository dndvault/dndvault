#### 11c. Trobriand's Body

![Scaladar](img/adventure/WDMM/078-23-04.webp)

The body of a frail man in dark robes lies atop a stone slab near the south wall. The man has long, wavy hair and a thick beard the color of iron, and he wears a metal ring on the index finger of his left hand.

Characters who have seen images of **Trobriand** know that the body lying on the slab is his. After **Trobriand** successfully transferred his spirit to an iron golem (see area 13), his body was placed here by the scaladar servants that guard area 11b. The body is in stasis but can be attacked normally. It is unconscious and has AC 12 and 99 hit points. Without its spirit, the body is an empty vessel, and **Trobriand** is unaware of what's happening to it while his spirit resides elsewhere. Destroying this body prevents **Trobriand**'s spirit from returning to it when the spirit is forced to vacate the golem in area 13, effectively killing the Metal Mage.

***Treasure.*** **Trobriand** wears a black metal ring on the index finger of his left hand that controls scaladar and overrides all other rings that have that property. It functions only within Undermountain (see the "**Scaladar**" entry in *appendix A*).

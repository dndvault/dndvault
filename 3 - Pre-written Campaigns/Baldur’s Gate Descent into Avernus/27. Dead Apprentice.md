>**Quilt**. A moldy quilt is draped over a stone bier against the south wall.

The inanimate skeleton belongs to a human apprentice named Kazvark, whom **Arcturia** killed with a barrage of magic missiles for failing to complete a simple homework assignment. **Arcturia** destroyed Kazvark's spellbook but didn't check his pockets for valuables.

#### Mithral Key

Characters who search the apprentice's robes find a 6-inch-long, flat piece of mithral shaped like a U in one pocket. This key is one of six required to activate the weapon of mass disintegration in area 37.

# 38. Guest Quarters

**Arcturia** keeps this room for special guests, such as Halaster or visiting wizards who have magic to trade. Its features are as follows:

>**Furnishings**. A large canopied bed dominates the eastern alcove. At the foot of the bed rests a large iron chest with a flat lid and clawed feet. An owlbear rug is splayed across the floor in front of the chest and the bed.
>
>**Alcove**. A black curtain conceals an alcove to the southwest. In front of the curtain is an overstuffed leather chair and a small table with a crystal decanter.
>

The alcove contains a stone statue that lacks fine features, resembling a blank-faced humanoid. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the statue, which alters its form to mimic the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid that touches it. The statue has no other properties.

#### Trapped Chest

The chest has an iron key in its lock, and turning the key unlocks it. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic emanating from inside the chest.

The chest is empty except for a magic mirror fastened to the inside of its lid. Any creature that sees its reflection in the mirror is targeted by a *flesh to stone* spell (save DC 20). Once the spell has been triggered, the mirror ceases to be magical.

#### Treasure

The crystal decanter is worth 250 gp but is fragile. It contains cheap wine. The owlbear rug is worth 75 gp.

# 6. Looted Chest

>**Scorch Marks**. This circular chamber has a 20-foot-high domed ceiling. Every surface is scorched and covered with soot, in a manner suggesting that multiple fiery explosions have occurred here.
>
>**Xunderbrok**. On a section of the back wall, an exclamation is scrawled in the soot: XUNDERBROK! (A previous explorer spelled this word on the wall. For information on its meaning, see area 39c on level 6.)
>
>**Chest**. A stone chest also blackened by soot lies open in the middle of the floor. (The stone chest is empty, its contents looted long ago. It weighs 500 pounds.)

#### Teleport Trap

In addition to the empty chest, the middle 10-foot square of the room contains a teleport trap (see "Teleport Traps"). A creature teleported by this trap arrives at a location determined by rolling a d20 and consulting the following table:

|  d20  | Teleport Destination          |
|:-----:|-------------------------------|
|  1–6  | The teleport trap in area 13a |
|  7–12 | The teleport trap in area 22b |
| 13–20 | The teleport trap in area 40c |

# 33. Shots in the Dark

This room is empty except for a pair of loaded wooden ballistae aimed squarely at the doors. When either door is opened, magic causes the ballista across from the door to discharge its wooden bolt, targeting the first creature in its path. Each ballista has a +6 bonus to hit and deals 16 (3d10) piercing damage on a hit.

The ballistae are securely bolted to the floor, and each comes equipped with one bolt.

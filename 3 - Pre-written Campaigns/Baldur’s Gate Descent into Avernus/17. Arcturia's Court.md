# 17. Arcturia's Court

Characters who listen at the doors to this room hear harp music beyond. The room has a vaulted ceiling 20 feet high and contains the following:

>**Arcturia**. **Arcturia**—a gaunt figure with blue scales, bone spurs on her forearms and elbows, gossamer wings, and a flowing gown—dances to music atop a stepped dais 5 feet higher than the rest of the room.
>
>**Butterfly Swarm**. Next to **Arcturia**, a harmless swarm of yellow butterflies has assumed a vaguely humanoid shape and is playing an elegant harp (see "Treasure" below). The harp rests on a stout wooden table. The swarm is under **Arcturia**'s control and disperses when **Arcturia** isn't around.
>
>**Dais Doors**. Set into the back wall of the dais are two identical doors. The southeast door is trapped (see "Southeast Door" below).
>
>**Furnishings**. Arranged throughout the hall are four stuffed chairs, four padded footstools, two divans, and two large coffee tables. (These furnishings are twelve **mimics** in disguise. **Arcturia** considers them her most trusted friends. If the lich comes under attack or takes umbrage with visitors, the mimics are quick to reveal their true forms and fight alongside her.)
>
>**Animal-Headed People**. Standing between eight pillars are six humanoids that have the heads of beasts. Three wear servants' uniforms and carry feather dusters, and three wear heavy armor and carry swords.

#### Arcturia

![{@creature Arcturia|WDMM}](img/adventure/WDMM/079-23-05.webp)

**Arcturia** is a **lich**, with these changes:

- In addition to her walking speed, **Arcturia** has a flying speed of 60 feet and can hover.
- She can cast the *alter self* spell at will and uses the following list of prepared spells:

- Cantrips (at will): *mage hand*, *prestidigitation*, *ray of frost*
- 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic*, *magic missile*, *shield*, *thunderwave*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts*, *enlarge/reduce*, *Melf's acid arrow*, *mirror image*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell*, *dispel magic*, *fireball*, *slow*
- 4th level (3 slots): *blight*, *polymorph*
- 5th level (3 slots): *animate objects*, *telekinesis*
- 6th level (1 slot): *disintegrate*, *flesh to stone*
- 7th level (1 slot): *reverse gravity*, *teleport*
- 8th level (1 slot): *feeblemind*, *maze*
- 9th level (1 slot): *true polymorph*

Unable to abide normalcy and consistency, **Arcturia** fixates on transforming herself, her surroundings, and other creatures. Her moods are ever-changing as well.

If the characters destroyed her phylactery on *level 14*, **Arcturia** knows what they did and attacks them at once. Otherwise, she has no grievance with the adventurers and is happy to let them go on their way, neither helping or hindering their efforts.

#### Animal-Headed Humanoids

Like **Rabbithead** in area 14, these six creatures are animals transformed into humanoids by **Arcturia**'s magic. They have the following traits in common:

- They are unaligned.
- They can't speak and know no languages.

The three humanoids wearing armor are **champions** (see *appendix A*) with the heads of a dingo, an iguana, and a stork. If **Arcturia** becomes embroiled in a battle, two of them fight on her side. The one with the dingo head, who secretly despises **Arcturia**, sides with her enemies against her. Each guard carries a yellow sapphire (see "Treasure" below).

The three servants are unarmed **commoners** with the heads of an aardvark, a moth, and a shrew. Whenever **Arcturia** snaps her fingers and points to a spot in the room, these servants begin dusting that location and don't stop until she snaps her fingers again. They otherwise avoid combat.

#### Southeast Door

This door has a stone wall behind it, inscribed upon which is an elder rune (see "Elder Runes"). Determine the rune randomly by drawing a card from the Elder Runes Deck (see *appendix B*). The rune targets the creature closest to the open door. It then vanishes until the door is closed, whereupon another elder rune appears in its place.

#### Treasure

The harp played by the butterfly swarm is an *instrument of the bards* (Anstruth harp).

The yellow sapphires carried by the animal-headed guards fit into the pillars in area 8. Each gemstone is worth 1,000 gp.

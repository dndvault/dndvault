# 13. Vampire Dens

The stench of death pervades these filthy dens.

#### 13a. Mad Spawn

Brek, a **vampire spawn** who succumbed to despair and madness after falling out of Keresta's favor, is crouching on the ceiling in the northeast corner of this otherwise empty room, muttering to himself. He believes intruders to be figments of his imagination until they attack.

#### 13b. Resting Spawn

The floor of this room, littered with scores of wooden coffins, is difficult terrain. Some of the coffins are intact, while others have fallen apart with age. Most are empty, but three of the coffins contain resting **vampire spawn** named Deviana, Ezra, and Yuri. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check can move through this room without waking the spawn. Otherwise, all three awaken and attack.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search through all the coffins find a silver rod with one end carved in the shape of a key (70 gp). The rod unlocks the double door in area 18.

#### 13c. Empty Hall

Six web-draped pillars buttress the 20-foot-high ceiling of this otherwise empty hall.

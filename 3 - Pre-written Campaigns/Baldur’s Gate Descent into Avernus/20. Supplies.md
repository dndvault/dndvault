# 20. Supplies

Two **hobgoblins** are stationed outside this room, one in front of each door. Their orders are to guard the food supplies. A battle here alerts the hobgoblins in area 32, who arrive quickly to aid their allies.

The room is packed with crates of rations and barrels of fresh water, with narrow aisles meandering between the containers. The giants and the hobgoblins rely on this supply, and there's enough food and water to last for weeks.

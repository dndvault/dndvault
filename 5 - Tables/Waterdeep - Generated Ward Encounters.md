(Note to Dungeon Assistant/Smart Composer:  Crossreference this file with the location index)

### Castle Ward

The political and administrative heart of the city, the Castle Ward is home to the courts, the Palace of Waterdeep, Castle Waterdeep itself, and the City Guard barracks 1111. The streets are well-patrolled, and the atmosphere is one of official business and authority.

1. A Word From the Proprietor
    
    As the party passes 
    
    **The Pampered Traveler** inn (Building 40) on Selduth Street, the solemn proprietor, **Brathan Zilmer**, is standing at the door 2. He is the Guildmaster of the Fellowship of Innkeepers and is observing the street with a wary eye, always alert for some sign that the evil mage who slaughtered his former adventuring band has finally found him 3333. He might offer a curt nod or a quiet warning about the dangers of the city.
    
2. Book Thief
    
    An apprentice wizard tears pages from a library book and eats them as five acolytes from the 
    
    **Font of Knowledge** (Building 3), the temple to Oghma, chase him down the **Street of the Sword**4444444444444. The apprentice believes he must consume knowledge to truly understand it.
    
3. Procession to the Spires
    
    A religious procession of Lathander's faithful, dressed in sunrise hues, makes its way to the Spires of the Morning (Building 43) on the Street of the Sword. They are celebrating Rhyestertide, and many keep one eye covered in honor of the prophet 555. They invite the characters to join them in their celebration.
    
4. Yawning Portal Escapade
    
    As the characters pass the famed Yawning Portal inn (Building 4), a commotion erupts. A wounded adventurer is hauled up from the well leading to Undermountain, followed by a snarling monster (such as a 
    
    **Troll** or a few **Goblins**) that has pursued them to the surface 6666666666666666. The proprietor, 
    
    **Durnan the Wanderer**, shouts for aid while calmly drawing his greatsword.
    
5. Ansilver's Security
    
    Outside The Golden Key (Building 21) on Warriors' Way, the elderly but alert proprietor, Ansilver the Locksmith, is demonstrating a new custom lock to a wealthy merchant. Unseen on the roof above, one of his four gargoyle guardians shifts its position, dislodging a piece of slate that clatters to the street near the party 7777.
    
6. Dispute at the Halls of Justice
    
    Near the Halls of Justice on Waterdeep Way, the temple to Tyr, a black-robed magister like Hester Barch is sentencing a petty criminal on the street. The sentence (e.g., a fine, a day in the stocks) seems overly harsh, and a small crowd of "concerned citizens" has gathered, muttering about injustice.
    
7. Ahghairon's Legacy
    
    A group of commoners and a few wizards from the Tower of the Order (Building 30) are placing violets at the base of Ahghairon's Tower, the magically sealed former home of Waterdeep's first Open Lord. A character who shows respect might be approached by an apprentice wizard with a cryptic piece of historical lore.
    
8. Mirt the Moneylender's Business
    
    A covered carriage is parked outside Mirt's Mansion (Building 1). Two of Mirt's veteran bodyguards are supervising the loading of a heavy, iron-bound chest. The guards are wary of anyone who lingers, suspecting they might be spies for one of Mirt's many rivals. The gruff, ex-mercenary himself might be seen shouting orders from a window 8.
    
9. Political Demonstration
    
    A small but vocal group of agitators gathers near Virgin's Square, the traditional hiring spot for mercenaries. They are protesting the anonymity of the Lords of Waterdeep, wearing masks themselves to hide their identities from the authorities 9. They try to pull a mask off anyone wearing one.
    
10. A Song from the Sword
    
    As the party passes 
    
    **The Singing Sword** tavern (Building 41), a pretty girl in mock armor struggles to lift the magical black blade for its hourly performance 10. The proprietor, the tall and polite 
    
    **Gothmorgan Ilibuld**, watches with a calm smile as the sword begins to sing a tragic ballad in a clear, bell-like voice11111111.
    

---

### Sea Ward

The wealthiest ward, home to noble villas, grand temples, and the city's coliseum 12121212. The streets are wide, clean, and patrolled by the Watch, but intrigue and rivalries simmer beneath the polished surface.

1. Noble and Retinue
    
    A noble family, such as Ammalia and Victoro Cassalanter (Building 68) or the Tespers (Building 89), travels down Diamond Street in an ornate carriage or on foot. They are escorted by two veteran bodyguards and four servants 13. The noble might ask for directions, comment on the characters' appearance, or demand they clear the way.
    
2. Haywire Experiment
    
    Alarms blare from the 
    
    **House of Inspired Hands** (Building 60), the temple of Gond on **Seawatch Street** 141414141414141414. A haywire experiment—perhaps a Shield Guardian marching heedlessly, four gargoyles dropping things from above, or a white-hot Helmed Horror—bursts onto the street, chased by panicked acolytes 151515151515151515. The head priestess, a dragonborn named 
    
    **Valetta**, can be seen directing the containment efforts.
    
3. Day at the Coliseum
    
    Crowds are thick around the 
    
    **Field of Triumph** (Building 16), Waterdeep's great coliseum 16161616. A gladiatorial contest or a ward race is about to begin. The Xanathar Guild may use the crowd as cover to rig a vendor's cart to explode, with a repentant half-orc bandit named 
    
    **Gouge** trying to warn the characters 17.
    
4. A Drink at the Fiery Flagon
    
    The party passes 
    
    **The Fiery Flagon** (Building 61), a tavern famous among sailors18. Inside, the fat, weathered proprietor 
    
    **Ulscaleer Anbersyr** is regaling patrons with tales of the sea amidst a decor of nets, figureheads, and the skeleton of an eye of the deep 19191919. He is rumored to be a fence for pirates20.
    
5. The Blue Alley's Lure
    
    The characters spot faint blue tiles on the streets and walls near 
    
    **Pharra's Alley**, leading into an alley that passes under buildings 21. This is the entrance to the infamous Blue Alley, a deadly maze from which most who enter never return 22. Locals will warn them away, but a shadowy figure might offer a reward for retrieving something from inside.
    
6. Living Statues
    
    Inside the 
    
    **House of Heroes** (Building 49), the grand temple to Tempus, three statues of champions from a rival ward have animated and are beating up a man wearing the wrong ward colors 23232323. The runes causing them to animate were etched by a mad mage named 
    
    **Luva Peersak** from the **House of Wonder** (Building 83) 24242424.
    
7. Runaway Griffon
    
    A Griffon Cavalry rider has lost control of her mount, 
    
    **Frigidbeak** 25. It flies erratically about 50 feet above the street near the 
    
    **House of the Moon** (Building 56). The rider, 
    
    **Kiri Xian**, needs help calming the beast before it crashes 26.
    
8. Unwanted Attention
    
    A sun elf spy and reporter for 
    
    _The Targe_ broadsheet, **Kelia Wintersbane**, shadows the party, looking for a hit piece on adventurers 27. She might approach them on a street like 
    
    **Delzorin Street** or **Vondil Street**, asking for an interview under false pretenses.
    
9. Gossip at Gounar's
    
    At 
    
    **Gounar's Tavern** (Building 55), a bright, mirrored place where nobles go to be seen, the coldly egotistical proprietor **Doblin Gounar** is fawning over a wealthy patron 28. The party might overhear gossip about the affair of a prominent noble or a recent scandal involving a wizard's duel.
    
10. A Ghost at Tespergates
    
    If it is evening, a party is likely underway at 
    
    **Tespergates** (Building 89), the villa of the Tesper noble family 29. Amidst the music and revelry, the silent, spectral ghost of one of the long-dead Tesper sisters drifts through a wall, causing a minor stir among the guests before fading away30.

### North Ward

A quiet, respectable ward home to many prosperous, non-noble families and a few noble houses 31313131. Its streets are noted for the flocks of doves that circle overhead and the public walkway along the eastern cliffs 32.

1. Servants' Rush Hour
    
    Just after dawn on a street like 
    
    **Whaelgond Way** or **Ussilbran Street**, drays arrive carrying servants from other wards 33333333. Dressed in the colors of their trade (cooks in white, gardeners in green, etc.), they spread out to their places of employment. A bit of chaos ensues as a dropped crate of chickens or a runaway pie cart disrupts the orderly procession.
    
2. Noble Scions' Prank
    
    A group of young, bored nobles from families like the Thanns (Building 139) or Gralhunds (Building 152) are causing trouble. They might be using minor illusions to spook horses outside The Galloping Minotaur inn (Building 110) or trying to get a rise out of the City Watch with witty insults. The Gralhund children, Greth, Zartan, and Tomassin, might be involved.
    
3. Trollskull Alley Business
    
    Near Trollskull Alley, the party might encounter Fala Lefaliir, a wood elf herbalist running her shop, Corellon's Crown. Alternatively, they might see the half-elf Talisolvanar "Tally" Fellbranch working at his carpentry shop, The Bent Nail. The alley may also be haunted by the ghost of a former bartender named Lif.
    
4. Cliffwatch Contemplation
    
    The party finds a lone figure staring out over the eastern countryside from the public walkway along the cliffs. This could be a philosopher, an artist sketching the view, or a Harper agent like Renaer Neverember waiting to meet a contact.
    
5. A Plea for Health
    
    A citizen rushes out from the House of Healing (Building 117), the Apothecaries' & Physicians' Guildhall, seeking aid. A rare ingredient is needed for a vital antidote, and the guild offers a handsome reward to any adventurers willing to procure it quickly.
    
6. A Drink at the Misty Beard
    
    The party enters 
    
    **The Misty Beard** tavern (Building 155), a place staffed by exotic and monstrous beings 34. The bartender, a dignified lizard man named 
    
    **Munzrim Marlpar**, is in a deep philosophical discussion with **Thoim Zalamm**, a beholder-like spectator floating behind the bar 35.
    
7. Fleeing Thief
    
    A thief, having just robbed a noble villa like that of the Roaringhorns (Building 145) or Nandars (Building 138), dashes through the streets. They try to slip a stolen item (a silver locket, a pouch of gems) into a character's pocket to avoid being caught with it by the pursuing City Watch patrol.
    
8. Manycats Alley Sighting
    
    As the party passes 
    
    **Manycats Alley**, known for its feline population and carved stone heads, they might hear one of the heads whisper a cryptic message 36. Alternatively, a local butcher from a nearby shop accuses them of frightening his cats.

### Trades Ward

The commercial core of Waterdeep, a dizzying maze of shops, guildhalls, and taverns, with balcony walkways crisscrossing above the crowded streets 37373737. The Watch is ever-present, but so is opportunity—both legal and illicit.

1. Guild War
    
    Two rival guilds are brawling in the street, with 2d8 commoners on each side 38. The brawl could be between the 
    
    **Bakers' Guild** (Building 22) and the **Council of Farmer-Grocers** (Building 42) over grain prices near the **Market Hall**, or the **Launderers' Guild** (Building 185) and the **Weavers' Guild** (Building 190) over a dye incident.
    
2. A Warrior's Test
    
    At The Snookery (Building 170), the home and training hall of the weapons tutor Myrmith Splendon, the sounds of combat ring out.

3. Court of the White Bull
    
    Near the intersection of Gondalim's Way and The High Road, the party enters the Court of the White Bull. Magic here is notoriously unreliable due to a past spell battle that tore the Weave 40. Any spell cast here may trigger a wild magic surge.
    
4. Snake Oil Salesman
    
    A charismatic salesman (suggested name: Phineas Phobble) stands on a crate on Virgin's Square, touting a tonic as a cure-all. The tonic costs 20 gp, but there's only a 10% chance it works like a 
    
    _potion of vitality_; otherwise, it's useless 41.
    
5. Steam and Steel
    
    The party passes the workshop of Embric (a fire genasi) and Avi (a water genasi), a well-regarded armorsmith and weaponsmith. A disgruntled customer might be arguing with Embric over the price of a finely crafted blade.
    
6. Solicitor's Pitch
    
    A solicitor (suggested name: 
    
    **Abricade Fellswop**) approaches the party on **Sable Street** or near a guildhall like the **House of Light**(Building 200) and offers their legal services for 2 gp per day 424242424242424242. Hiring them grants advantage on ability checks when dealing with guilds or city authorities 43.
    
7. Fallen Money Pouch
    
    A character spots a money pouch in the gutter. It might contain 1d6 gp and a note, an angry poisonous snake, or pebbles as bait for an assassin's ambush 44444444. The prankster could be the gnome mage 
    
    **Igglewen Cogsworthy**, who offers to buy a round of drinks if the party takes the joke well 45.
    
8. The Bowels of the Earth
    
    Inside the dark, rough-and-tumble tavern The Bowels of the Earth (Building 198), mercenaries and adventurers trade tales in the gloom. The massive bartender, Ongamar Talthloon, effortlessly keeps the peace. A quiet man in the corner might be looking to hire a group for a dangerous job 46464646.
    
9. Dungsweepers' Guild
    
    A crew of dungsweepers, identifiable by their orange-and-red-feathered caps, is cleaning the street. They are gossiping loudly and might share a rumor from the Waterdeep Rumors table if tipped a few coins.
    
10. A Dagger for Hire
    
    The party passes the Inn of the Dripping Dagger (Building 168), a favorite haunt for mercenaries. The proprietor, a jovial ex-mercenary named 
    
    **Filiare**, is out front haggling with a caravan master over the price of hiring a half-dozen guards for a trip north47474747.
    
11. Halfling Thief
    
    A halfling master thief named 
    
    **Wents** tries to sell the party a stolen _candle of invocation_ for 500 gp, claiming the money is for his sick mother 48. Shortly after, City Watch guards arrive, searching for the stolen item 49.
    
12. Unusual Wares
    
    The party passes the Old Xoblob Shop, where everything is purple. The deep gnome proprietor, Xoblob, tries to sell them a "magic" item that is mundane but painted a deep shade of violet.

### Southern Ward

A dense, maze-like ward that serves as the city's primary entry point for overland caravans 50505050. It is a melting pot of cultures, filled with stables, warehouses, and businesses catering to travelers.

1. Caravan Arrival
    
    A large caravan has just arrived through the South Gate, clogging The Way of the Dragon with wagons, mules, and guards from distant lands. Merchants are hawking their wares directly from their wagons, and a foreign dignitary might be looking to hire adventurers for protection within the city.
    
2. The Moon Sphere
    
    If it is the night of a full moon, a glowing blue sphere of magical energy appears in the 
    
    **Dancing Court** 51. Anyone who enters can fly within its bounds. The event draws skilled dancers and onlookers. Patrons of the nearby 
    
    **Jade Dancer** festhall (Building 208) might leap from the balconies into the sphere 52525252.
    
3. Kappiyan's Kindness
    
    A citizen with a strange magical malady (perhaps glowing skin or uncontrollably floating hair) is being led by a friend to the home of the wizard Kappiyan Flurmastyr (Building 218). Known for his kindness and expertise with potions, Kappiyan is their last hope for a cure 53535353.
    
4. Refugees Seeking Shelter
    
    A bedraggled group of refugees stumbles past, new to the city and short on coin. They ask for directions to the nearest temple, such as 
    
    **Helm's Hall** (an orphanage) 54545454. Helping them may earn the party future allies.
    
5. The Old Monster Shop
    
    Outside The Old Monster Shop on the Jar, the nondescript owner Feldyn Goadolfyn is negotiating the purchase of a caged creature from a band of adventurers. A loyal gargoyle perches on the shop's counter, watching the transaction with stony eyes 55555555.
    
6. Stables Fire
    
    A fire breaks out at one of the ward's many stables, such as Hlakken Stables (Building 224) or Redbridle Stables (Building 215). Panicked horses threaten to stampede into the crowded streets unless they are calmed and rescued.
    
7. The Waymoot
    
    At the great crossroads known as the 
    
    **Waymoot**, a group of newcomers are confused by the magical signpost that only gives directions to locations _outside_ the city 56565656. A number of city guides—some reputable, some not—are competing for their business 57.
    
8. Ruid's Stroll Haunting
    
    On a foggy night, the hooded ghost of the mage Ruid appears in the alley known as Ruid's Stroll. His touch is deathly cold, but those who let him pass through them may learn a secret truth—if they survive the ordeal 58.
    

---

### Dock Ward

The oldest and one of the poorest wards, the Dock Ward is a district of steep, narrow streets, sailors' taverns, and tightly packed tenements. It is a rough neighborhood where crime is common, especially after dark when the streets are unlit 59.

1. A Drink at the Thirsty Sailor
    
    The party passes 
    
    **The Thirsty Sailor** tavern (Building 269), a notorious dive60. Inside, the proprietor, 
    
    **Kaeroven “Smiles” Yuluth**, a tall, unpleasant man with razor scars on his face, watches a brawl with a cold stare. His rat-like spy, 
    
    **Winestab**, lurks in a corner, eavesdropping 61616161.
    
2. Ship Crimp
    
    A friendly veteran offers to buy the characters a drink at a tavern like 
    
    **The Sleeping Snake** (Building 245) 62626262. He is a "crimp" who will lace their drinks with torpor and force any who succumb to sign a ship's contract for an understaffed merchant vessel.
    
3. Three Thrown Daggers Alley
    
    As the party passes 
    
    **Three Thrown Daggers Alley**, a magical curse activates, causing three spectral daggers to appear and attack a random passerby before vanishing 63. Locals boast of how many times they've survived the alley, but it's entirely unpredictable 64.
    
4. A Message at Serpentil Books
    
    At Serpentil Books & Folios (Building 275), the dusty and exclusive shop of Jannaxil Serpentil, a cloaked figure is seen slipping a message under the door. Jannaxil, a nasty old scholar who deals in blackmail, may have just received new leverage on one of the city's powerful figures656565656565656565.
    
5. Sea Spawn Attack
    
    2d4 horrifying sea spawn crawl out of the harbor and attack a dockside warehouse. They have been sent by a sea hag named

6. The Blushing Mermaid
    
    The party passes the luxurious festhall The Blushing Mermaid (Building 249).

She is secretly an archlich who must drain life to survive 67676767676767676767676767676767.
    
7. The Hand That Sings
    
    In Brindul Alley, the party encounters a magical phantasm: a disembodied hand with a mouth in its palm. It eerily sings old ballads as it drifts through the night. It is known to snatch valuables, especially magical ones, and may attack those who bother it 68.
    
8. Muleskull Tavern
    
    At the Muleskull Tavern (Building 263), the headquarters of the Dungsweepers' Guild, the characters overhear guild members complaining about a merchant in the Trades Ward who is refusing to pay his fees. They are planning to teach him a lesson by sabotaging a fish wagon outside his shop.
    
9. The Ship's Prow
    
    At The Ship's Prow inn (Building 268), the one-eyed, retired sailor proprietor Jhambrote Harkhardest is arguing with a patron about the tales of a red dragon that once laired in the building's cellars. The resident wizard, 
    
    **Shryndalla Ghaulduth**, watches with amusement, surrounded by her spy-cats69696969696969696969696969696969.

    The party witnesses a clandestine meeting in a dark alley off Sail Street or Fish Street.

They will attack anyone who discovers them.

### City of the Dead

Waterdeep's cemetery is a beautiful, park-like space with grassy hills, sculptures, and grand mausoleums 70. It is a popular place for picnics and strolls during the day, but is walled off and patrolled at night to contain the restless dead.

1. Funeral Procession
    
    A somber funeral procession for a City Watch officer, slain by a drunken adventurer, makes its way to one of the mausoleums 71. Any adventurers present are met with scorn and disgust from the 3d6 commoners and 3d6 guards in attendance 72.
    
2. Grave Robbers
    
    A group of gangsters, perhaps led by the grave robbers Urlaster Ghann and Volkarr Kibbens, are posing as a funeral party to exhume a grave near the Merchants' Rest tomb (Building 165) to retrieve a buried treasure map. A master thief keeps watch while 1d6 thugs dig.
    
3. Unearthed Evil
    
    Due to a necromantic artifact unearthed by a priest at the 
    
    **House of Headstones**, 1d6 skeletons and 1d3 zombies burrow out of their graves and begin to wander aimlessly 73. They are not immediately hostile but will attack if disturbed. The priest, 
    
    **Victus Payne**, has locked himself inside the shrine to study the artifact and has been warped into a necromancer 74747474.
    
4. The Child's Ghost
    
    The spectral ghost of a young child appears, crying for their mother, "Shafkii" 75. It speaks an archaic form of Chondathan and is oblivious to its own death, unable to leave the graveyard 76.
    
5. Cultists' Ritual
    
    A group of six cultists are performing a ritual around an overturned headstone near the 
    
    **Warrior's Monument** (Building 164) 77777777. They have sacrificed a cat and are chanting to a dark god (Bhaal, Loviatar, Malar, or Talona) 78787878. They will flee if confronted, but may return later with their cult fanatic leader 79.
    
6. Groundskeeper's Plea
    
    An elderly human groundskeeper, 
    
    **Melvyn Wake**, begs the party to investigate a section of the graveyard where the grass has become muddy and smells of rot 80. Digging there might reveal a mass grave with bodies branded with the symbol of Asmodeus, a sarcophagus containing a wraith, or an unknown crypt 81818181818181818181818181818181.

### Field Ward

Located between the inner and outer north walls, the Field Ward is not an official ward of the city 82. It is a muddy, lawless ghetto populated by refugees and the city's poorest residents, where the City Watch does not patrol 83.

1. Butchers' Work
    
    The stench of blood and tanning chemicals hangs heavy in the air near the slaughterhouses and leatheries run by the 
    
    **Guild of Butchers**84. A group of burly, blood-soaked butchers are taking a break, eyeing the characters suspiciously. Being friendly with them is a good way to secure safe passage through the area.
    
2. Off-Duty Guards
    
    A group of off-duty members of the City Guard are drinking heavily at the 
    
    **Endshift Tavern** (Building 15)85. They are complaining loudly about the dangers of their job and might pick a fight with any adventurers who seem to be showing off.
    
3. Otyugh Attack
    
    A crowd has gathered around a rock gnome inventor, 
    
    **Dandyforth Zalesbottom**, whose magical "poopsweeper" has just burst open, revealing the hungry **otyugh** that was powering it 86. The creature is rampaging through the dung-covered ground, attacking anyone in sight.
    
4. Desperate Plea
    
    A refugee family, having been denied entry to the city proper, begs the party for food or coin. They were recently robbed of their last few possessions by a local gang and can point the party toward the thugs' tenement hideout.
    
5. Angry Mob
    
    1d4 thugs lead a mob of 2d12 commoners, protesting the lack of Watch patrols and demanding the city officially annex the ward 87. They are blocking the road and may turn violent if their demands are ignored.
    
6. Tainted Meat
    
    Near a butcher's stall, a teenager named Kilar Tanwith is choking on a meat pie. If the characters save him, he spits out a small bone that is part of a human finger 88. The pie came from a local stall whose owner, 
    
    **Nellie Amoret**, buys her meat from a dragonborn butcher named **Thrakkus**.

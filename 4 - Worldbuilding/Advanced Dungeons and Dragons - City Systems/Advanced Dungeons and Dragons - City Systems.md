# Using This Product 

CITY SYSTEM is a boxed campaign setting designed for urban adventures in the $\mathrm{AD} \& \mathrm{D} \circledast$ game system. While the mechanics presented within are adaptable for any city in the Realms, or in any other fantasy setting, this boxed set concentrates and expands upon the mightiest city of the Realms: Waterdeep, the City of Splendors.
The true stars of this product are the twelve map-sheets in this boxed set, the largest presentation anywhere of a fantasy city. The city is Waterdeep, but can be used for your own personal campaigns if you desire. The tables, charts, and information which follow are primarily to enhance the use of those maps.

## Arranging The Maps

Ten of the twelve maps in this set fit together form an expanded view of
the city of Waterdeep (see p. 3). Map sections overlap to provide a continuous tapestry of urban settings. Regions outside the city proper, such as the farmlands beyond and the sea areas, are used to show typical interior details of many of the buildings. These are arranged according to the typical buildings found within that quarter. Noble houses will be found aligning to the North and Sea Wards, while taverns will be found in the Dock and Trades Wards. These typical buildings may be used by player characters as bases of operations or targets for adventuring.
The eleventh map is a detailed interior diagram of Castle Waterdeep, headquarters of the effective civil government of the city. It is here that some of the Watch and Guards are posted, along with the keep armories and dungeons. It is also here that the Lords of Waterdeep, the secret rulers of the
city, hold their judgments, and receive emissaries and vistors from other lands. Here noted guests of the city stay in safety (where the Lords can keep a discreet eye on them). Castle Waterdeep is one of the oldest structures remaining from the days of the early settlement of the city-state. Its catapults stationed in the towers are still operative, but without magical aid their stones would scarcely clear the outer walls of the new city.
The final map is a picture of the city itself, drawn from the Outer Harbor islands, looking northward over the Dock Ward. The city is built on a sloping plateau that levels out about the same location as Castle Waterdeep, so details beyond that point are lost from this view. The illustration captures the great density and sheer size of the city itself.

# WATERDEEP AT A GLANCE 

![img-3.jpeg](assets/tsr01040%20-%20AD&D_FR_-_City_System_img-3.jpeg)

Many of the physical details of the City of Waterdeep can be found in FR1, Waterdeep and the North. For a detailed description of the ruling individuals, guilds and their functions, noble families and their heraldry, and the area surrounding Waterdeep, look into that tome. This text contains information about Waterdeep as it applies to cities in the Forgotten Realms-ranging from typical street encounters to a summary of the laws and peacekeeping forces in the city to opportunities for adventurers within the city's walls. Repeated information is intended to be kept to a minimum, and used only where necessary for clarity.
Waterdeep is the largest city of the North. There are metropolises in Calimshan, Amn, and reputedly Thay that exceed Waterdeep in sheer population, but none match the raw power and prestige of the City of Splendors. Waterdeep's population rarely dips beneath 120,000 sentient beings (this in the heart of winter), and during the busiest times of the year (the height of Trading Season), the number reaches upwards of half a million people.
Waterdeep is one of the newer cities as well, having survived and prospered under its current type of secret government for only some 350 years. A long trail of dark times, mysterious fires, and indeterminate spell-casting mark the years before the coming of Ahghairon, Lord of Waterdeep. Both for its growing size and relatively recent arrival, Waterdeep is regarded by larger, older cities to the south as something of an upstart, a home of the new rich and wildly unpredictable adventurers. The fact that Waterdeep recognizes and profits from the actions of adventurers is used as proof to
these old-line nations that Waterdeep is as barbarous as its surroundings. (See Timeline on page 4 for a brief history of the city).
Waterdeep is divided into seven administrative districts, or "wards." The borders between these wards are informal and, with the exception of the City of the Dead, there are no walls dividing them. Each ward has its own personality, and particular groups and individuals tend to collect towards one ward or another. Waterdhavian society has not stratified as much as some other cities: there is no "Noble Quarter" where all the titled heads are crammed within the reaches of a flame strike. Nor is there a "Foreign Quarter", as found in the South and West, where outside nationals and foreign races are confined. Waterdeep takes pride in its lack of such divisions, pointing out that it is an "Open City", while its detractors point out that it is one more example of the chaotic nature of the northerners.
The seven wards of the city are:

- Castle Ward-The Political Heart of the City, this ward encompasses both Castle Waterdeep and Piergeiron's Palace, the barracks, and Mount Waterdeep and its defensive system. It is a popular region for those who enjoy the whirl of politics, including adventurers seeking employment by the city.
- Sea Ward-North and West of Castle Ward, this region was open fields a hundred years ago, dotted by the villas of the rising noble class of the City. The metropolis has since swallowed the old villas, reducing them to walled islands in the midst of upperclass townhouses. Sea Ward is also center of the Faiths of Waterdeep, relocating with the
rising upper class from Dock and Trades Wards.
- North Ward-The other northern ward of Waterdeep, the buildings are slightly older, but still respectable and upper-middle class. Here too the old noble villas have been swallowed by the city. It is in North Ward where successful merchants maintain townhouses for their stays in the city, and where retired adventurers tend to spend their quiet years.
- City of the Dead-This is the only walled ward, and with good reason. Disposal of the deceased citizens in a fashion that will not result in their return is a problem for all towns large and small in the Realms. Waterdeep, backed by powerful magic, has chosen to create a series of pocket dimensions, where they may lay the dead to rest in comfort. Some undead, and darker creatures, do slip through in the night, and for this reason, the City is patrolled and night-time activity discouraged. Still, it is the largest park of its type in the North, and a favorite relaxation spot of the people.
- Trades Ward-This is the internal merchant and craftsmen's hub of the city, where most of Waterdeep's internal trading and manufacturing take place. Many of the respectable Guilds have their bases there, and it is here that most of the high-level economic dealing takes place.
- Southern Ward-If Waterdeep had a "Foreign Quarter", Southern Ward would be it. Nestled firmly against the major gate south, it is hear that many caravans stop to break up their cargos for sale and delivery in the city. Many southern merchants have not seen Waterdeep beyond this ward, and many foreign tongues and alien races are found here seeking others of their own breed. Southern ward is dominated by the requirements of the caravan trade: stables, warehouses, and taverns.
- Dock Ward-The oldest part of the city, it was in use over 2000 years ago as a trading center with ships from the south. Certain buildings, and most foundations, predate Castle Waterdeep and the founding of the city. It is a rough neighborhood which mixes vital business with shady operations at all hours of the night.

## A TimeUne of Waterdeep's History

In this brief outline, Waterdeep's system of numbering years is used (known as "Northreckoning," it is used throughout the human Northlands west of Anauroch). The current year is 1332 in Cormyr (whose system is used in Sembia, Westgate, and the western coastlands of The Sea of Fallen Stars) and 1357 in Dalereckoning (the system used in the Dalelands, the Moonsea lands to the north, and over much of Thar and the other Northlands to the east of Anauroch); note that Northreckoning dates from Ahghairon's ascension to the throne, and not the initial founding of the city.

# RULERSHIP 

Who rules a city is often of minor importance in the day-to-day operation of a civilized community. Only in the case of the most brutal, petty tyrants will player characters likely come into direct conflict with the mayors, lord, captain, lesser kings, and self-styled emperors who rule the cities of the Forgotten Realms. One piece of advice, though: should a character anger the rulers of a city, the safest course of action is to leave town quickly and quietly-all but the most despotic rulers enjoy a strong base of support in order to carry out their work.

This strong base of support applies to Waterdeep as well. Wracked by long internal battles in its history, the city has thrived for the first time in the past 300 years, under the ministrations of its hidden "Lords of Waterdeep." The number and names of these Lords are Waterdeep's most tightly-held secret, protected both by the magic-resistant masks they wear as well as (it is rumored) divine protection arranged by the various faiths that do good business in Waterdeep and support its rulers. It is commonly thought that there are 16 such rulers, though no more than 7 are seen at any one time.

Among the Lords there is always one "Open Lord," who wears no mask when conducting daily business for the city, and who is generally recognized as both the spokesman and symbolic head of the city. The current Open Lord is Piergeiron Paladinson, a paladin of 14th+ level, who has ruled the city-state wisely in his past 40 years in the position.

Some of the mysterious Lords of Waterdeep are detailed in FR1, Waterdeep and The North Sourcebook, but there are 6 left undescribed for the DM to create his own. The fact that the Lords are undiscovered and undiscovérable makes for an air of security in the city. Those with nothing to hide feel confident that a Lord may be around when needed, while those breaking the law are never sure that the person they are confiding in will not soon be sitting, masked and concealed, on the bench to judge them.

## Laws \& Peace-Keeping

Player characters in urban environments may not meet the king, but, if they engage in typical adventuring activities in the city, they will definitely encounter the ruler's minions. In Waterdeep, the prime peace-keeping forces are the Guard and the Watch.

The Guard are Waterdeep's soldiers, decked in scale mail and carrying short swords and bows; they are the city's protection. Outposts of the guards can be found throughout the walls ringing, the city, as well as at their barracks in Castle Ward, and at all gates into the city. At every gate, there will be a detachment of the Guard, 12 in number.

The Watch are Waterdeep's policemen, and are more commonly seen throughout the city, typically moving in patrols of four men. They are decked in armor of leather strengthened by chain, and carry rods (treat as clubs), daggers, and short swords.

The Watch and Guard are authorized to arrest any individuals breaking the law, and to bring in for questioning any individuals reported to be engaged in illegal activities. They may enter buildings without warning or hindrance, and search any person, place, or container by will.

The Watch will first attempt to have the arrested subject come along peacefully, but if this is not possible, they will fight. The Watch will seek to disarm and grapple opponents, while the Guard tends to kill first, ask questions later. In dangerous situations, the Watch will kill a suspect as well, using speak with dead spells to discover the true disposition of matters afterwards. Innocent parties slain by the Guard and/or Watch are provided with raise dead spells as is possible.

In dealing with powerful adventurers, who could easily defeat and/or slay large numbers of ordinary guardsmen, the Lords of Waterdeep have three
options, one of which is lesser-known. The first option is to enlist the aid of the local temples and faiths in dealing with the problem. Since this is tied with a large donation from the city to the faith that deals with the problem, most churches are eager to aid in the arrest and/or destruction of the high-powered interloper. Clerical spells are excellent in locating unprotected thieves, and aerial servants and the like can dispose of them on the doorstep of the local Guard (or more likely, within the dungeon directly).

The second option available to the Lords is the unleashing of Force Grey. Force Grey is a group of loyal, powerful Waterdhavians of equal or greater power than the supposed offenders. They can include the following individuals:
Khelben Arunsun - Also called Blackstaff, this 26th level magic-user is reported to be both a Lord of Waterdeep and the leader of Force Grey. He is active only when the city faces its most dire threats, but provides suitable spells and magical items for the rest of the team.
Jardwim - Official leader of the team, a 15th level ranger lord who uses two blink dogs as his aides. Once something is called to his attention, there is little he cannot find. Gruff and stocky, he is a believer that if a problem is sufficient to bring him into the field, the only result is death for the opponents.
Maliantor - A 9th level magic-user and pupil of Khelben, Maliantor usually carries a scroll containing the necessary spells to contain the menace. She is known as "Blackstaff's eyes," and though rumors abound of a more intimate relationship between her and Khelben, such tales are never brought up to her face.
Harshnag the Grim - A frost giant in enchanted plate mail +4 , made for his giantish frame, he is the raw muscle-power with which the team deals with malefactors. Cast out by his people for overly good tendencies, he seeks acceptance in the company of humans.

![img-5.jpeg](assets/tsr01040%20-%20AD&D_FR_-_City_System_img-5.jpeg)

Hrusse of Assuran - A native of the Inner Sea lands with a thick, stilted accent, Hrusse is a 12th level cleric of Assuran, called Hoar in these part, the God of Revenge. No slight is forgotten, no task laid aside. He wears enchanted plate mail +2 , and carries a mace of disruption.
Osco Salibuck - A 9th-level halfling thief, once captured by the Force Grey and supposedly reformed, Osco would be lost among the greater lights were it not for a djinn ring he jealously guards. The djinn, one Amprantines, is very loyal to his halfling master. Osco is brought in for the quiet touch.
All of Force Grey are at maximum hit points, and should be equipped with further magical gear depending on the situation. Such gear is marked by Khelben so as to magically return (with whoever is carrying it) in a few days time.
In addition to the individuals noted above, Force Grey usually includes 2-8 fighters of 7 th or better level.
Not surprisingly, Force Grey is called out rarely, and its approach sends everyday civilians in the opposite direction. An assault by the Force usually results in the destruction of one or more buildings, and widespread slaughter. They are used when no other method is available.
In cases where Force Grey is insufficient (a tarrasque on the horizon), a general call is made to all adventuring citizens to come to the aid of the city. This has not happened in the 40 years of Piergeiron's rule.
Finally, individuals disrupting the peace may earn the wrath of the Red Sashes, a mysterious group that operates within the city as "rivals" to the Lords of Waterdeep. Led by the "The One," this group of neutrally-aligned characters are very effective in removing individuals who are creating problems for the city, not bothering with the niceties of arrest and trial. This Society, while not a thieves' guild, has many characters with thiefly abilities in its ranks, and engages in a quiet approach
of theft, threat, blackmail, and kidnaping to bring malefactors to justice. They can be hired for particular actions, though they have never been successful in toppling the Lords of Waterdeep. Their contacts may be found at:

| Thentavva's Boots | Bldg 177 |
| :-- | :-- |
| Hlakken Stables | Bldg 223 |
| The Purple Palace | Bldg 260 |
| The Sleeping Snake | Bldg 245 |

The Red Sashes gain their names from the red cloth used to bind up the guilty to be turned over to the local officials.

## Justice

Waterdeep has two levels to its legal system: The Magisters and The Lord's Court. There are 26 magisters, or "black-robes", in the city, and they may normally be found either at the Palace ( 3 at all times) or the city gates ( 1 during daylight hours). The Magisters may pass instantaneous judgment on serious or less important crimes. Local citizens may appeal any ruling of the Magisters in the Lords Court within two days.
The Lord's Court is chaired by Piergeiron and two other masked Lords of Waterdeep, and is held at the Castle Waterdeep each day, beginning at noon. This court hears all appeals, plus all severe crimes. Justice is swift and usually accurate in Waterdeep. A magical society, backed up by detect lie spells from the churches, can usually reach at the heart of the matter in a short time. The suggested punishments listed for offenders may be lessened according to situation, but ignorance of the law is no excuse for illegal behavior. There are no bail, no lawyers, and rarely any repeal of crimes. The Lords Court will usually let a Magister's statement stand unless there is information brought to light since then. In game terms, the Court system of Waterdeep is $95 \%$ likely to render a correct verdict as to the matters of the situation. The rest of the time there are sufficient unknowns that matters are dropped (unless the case is severe, in which case the least
that will occur will be banishment from the city).
Imprisonment: In addition to finding them guilty, Magisters sometimes order confinement-and to a busy merchant, imprisonment may result in a far greater loss of income than the fine that goes with it. After two days of confinement, prisoners are always brought before the Lords, and examined by a physician before them. Most merchants use this audience to plea for early release in return for the payment of more money. Lords sometimes agree to this, but try to consult with the Black Robe who sentenced the offender first, to determine the reason for imprisonment. The extensive, many-levelled City jail is in (and beneath) Castle Waterdeep, but small holding cells (six cells of up to ten people in each) are contained in the Palace and all major towers (those with names) along the wall. These are used in times of trouble. Waterdeep's prison system (The Dungeons) is on a par with most found in the Realms. The largest complex is located beneath Castle Waterdeep, and protected by magical wards and special cells to keep magical powers at bay. Escape is possible, but rare. For player characters, being sent into prison is virtual retirement for that character until the sentence is up. DM's may seek to have their sentence commuted into some great act for the city, usually involving great personal risk and/or danger. The individual will be quested and/or geased to perform the action, and if the PC breaks the spell, he or she will be captured and slain upon return to Waterdeep.

# CODE LEGAL 

Crimes and their corresponding sentences, as administered by the Lords and Magisters of Waterdeep, can be roughly summarized as set forth below. This system is known as the "Code Legal," and is only a basis for sentencing, not absolute rules. Note that both Lords and Magisters are free to determine absolutely guilt and innocence, and set any lesser sentence they consider fitting (or none at all) if a crime is deemed justified or largely harmless and unintentional. A single act can result in multiple charges, under one or more of the four "Plaints". Magisterial justice may be appealed to the Lords by anyone, but such appeals must be within nine days of the initial sentencing, and non-citizens of Waterdeep must persuade a citizen of the City to appeal on their behalf. The four Plaints are the four different classes of aggrieved parties; that is, those who are injured by a crime. They are Crimes Against The Lords; Crimes Against The City; Crimes Against The Gods; and Crimes Against Citizens. Under each Plaint are four classes of crimes. These four types of offenses are Severe; Serious; Lesser; and Minor. The sentences have been set forth below in a chart to save space. After the letter that denotes a type of punishment, an amount (of time or money) usually follows. The commercial nature of the City, with its emphasis on mercantile trade and property, is clearly reflected in these "typical" punishment. The City is empowered to seize and sell the property of a convict to realize the money needed to satisfy the payment of fines or damages, without the consent of a convict. The family, clan, guild, or business partners of a convict are never liable for the payment of a convict's fines or damages, unless they can be proven to have aided, abetted, ordered, or coerced a convict into the criminal activity in question. Temples and priesthoods are not permitted to pass or carry out sentences under the Third Plaint; only officers of the City may do so. Convicted beings may owe fines to the City and pay as they can over time, but only
upon permission of a Lord or Magister, who will typically demand at least a partial payment immediately.

B Death (upon conviction)
C Exile or Ban Against Future Entry

A DM should use the "elbow room" created by this discretionary legal system just as the Lords do; to create any necessary decrees to prevent player characters from running amok. Magisters and Lords have in the past made laws (edicts) specific to fit particular situations and crimes. In Waterdeep, at least, the guilty tend to be punished for their crimes according to their severity.

# THE BUILDINGS OF WATERDEEP 

Each Dungeon Master should make Waterdeep his or her own, filling in details as necessary for exciting play, and the day-to-day adventures of play ing characters. To that end, the DM, using the descriptions and room designs found within as a base, should feel free to modify, change, add to, or subtract from the city, customizing Waterdeep to his own ends. New buildings may be designated as they become more important to the PCs, or neighborhoods changed to fit in with the requirements of an adventure.

Buildings are numbered 1-282 in the "official" listing which follows, so in keeping with this, any newly designated buildings should have numbers higher than 282; If that elven fightermage buys his own townhouse near the Grey Serpent Inn, his house would be listed as bldg 283, the temple his friends set up to Waukeen 284, and so on. Mark these locations on the map, and their reference locations, by grid, or location with streets, on a separate piece of paper (otherwise it is all too easy to lose the locations of the buildings on such a large map).

The layout of buildings in play may become important if PCs engage in extensive indoor thieving, stealthy shadowing, and fighting. Space considerations prohibit the provision of floor plans for every building in the city, but the "typical layouts" provided on the map may serve as basis for your own developments, and to be used as a "quick location" if the players need one. A simpler version of these tables appeared in FRI, Waterdeep and the North.

Random generation of the overall natures of buildings may be accomplished using the table below. Random generation of Class A buildings (see below) and of specific buildings intended beforehand for use in play is not recommended. If a building so generated proves to be a new focal point of the campaign, then the DM is advised to add it to the growing list of standard buildings in his or her own version of Waterdeep.

Buildings in the City can be artificially divided into four classes, as follows.

Class A: The Palace, Castle Waterdeep, other public structures (e.g. the Arena), major temples (including The Plinth), noble villas. These buildings are unique, generally large and grand, and random tables are not given here.

Class B: Grand houses (without grounds or walled gardens; villas always have such), large warehouses, prosperous businesses, guildhalls. Buildings in this class have up to four stories, and may have extensive cellars (usually connected to the sewers at some point). Most inns in the City fall into this class.

Class C: Row buildings. This class describes the great majority of city buildings, of two or three stories, and usually having shops on the ground floor, with offices above and apartments above that (or just apartments). This class includes most of the taverns and rooming houses in the City.

Class D: Lesser buildings (hovels, sheds, small warehouses). This class consists of one-story buildings, usually of wood, and are mainly found in Dock Ward, with a few in Southern Ward and Trades Ward, and a handful in the part of the docks which lies in Castle Ward.

Once the class of a given building has been decided by the DM, the following steps can be followed if speedy random generation of building features is desired.

1. Determine the building Type, either through the DM's choice, or by rolling on the table below:

| Ward | B | C | D |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Castle | $1-4$ | $5-8$ | $9-0$ |
| North | $1-6$ | $7-0$ |  |
| Sea | $1-7$ | $8-0$ |  |
| Trades | $1-3$ | $4-7$ | $8-0$ |
| South | $1-2$ | $5-7$ | $8-0$ |
| Dock | 1 | $2-6$ | $7-0$ |

The City of the Dead consists entirely of type "A" buildings which the DM should detail when called upon.
2. Determine number of stories in building, by deliberate choice or by the methods that follow. Look for the Type of building and roll or choose from that table.

## Class B: (1d8)

1. One story without basement
2. Two stories without basement
3. Three stories without basement
4. Four stories, without basement
5. One story, with basement
6. Two stories, with basement
7. Three stories with basement
8. Four stories, basement, tower with additional floors possible

## Class C (1d4)

1. Two stories without basement
2. Three stories without basement
3. Three stories with basement
4. Two stories with basement

## Class D (1d4)

1-2. One story, without basement
3. One story, with basement
4. One story, with tower or partial upper level.
5. Determine condition of building, by choice or rolling 1d8. Add one to the roll if in Sea or North Ward, subtract one if in Dock or Southern Ward.
0-1 Derelict, boarded up, abandoned
2 Ramshackle, in need of repair
3-4 Well-worn, heavy daily use, some need of repairs
5-6 In good condition, well-kept, and clean
7 Under construction, or extensive repair
8-9 New, well-cared for, and freshly redecorated.
4. Determine function of building, by deliberate choice or by rolling 1d10. Consult the table below according to Building Class.

As DM, feel free to add as you see fit (and perhaps even removing a few of the above structures or changing their purpose in play).

## Guide To Services

The prior list is useful in determining what is nearby when characters are on the map. To find a specific tradesman, noble family, or individual, the following listing is more helpful. Following each building is its number on the map, then the map's number, and the coordinates (vertical, then horizontal). A-1 is located in the left lower corner of any given map. Also listed are brief descriptions of most buildings.

# STREET SCENES 

Waterdeep, like most major cities, is a continually active, bustling place, where all manner and types of people are involved in their own day-today business. For most adventurers, who is on the street and what they are doing is only important in certain instances. For example, for a fighter heading across town, just who he happens to see will have little impact on his task. However, for a thief trying to pickpocket or a cleric attempting to evade the disguised agents of an evil magician, knowing who is in the immediate surroundings is of vital importance.

In cases where the surrounding people are important, these tables can create the framework for a typical street scene. In most situations these will provide nothing more than "local color" for a brawl, potential witnesses to a crime, and situations the characters can use in dealing with others. These tables are not to be used every time the player characters step out onto a street, as this would slow down play. Use them only when it becomes important to find out who is around at the time.

Tables of typical "street scenes" are provided for each ward of Waterdeep. The time of day will affect both the number of individuals on the scene, and the types of those individuals. Roll a four-sided die to determine the number of entries from the table which will be used to "set the scene." Roll percentile dice on the specific ward table to determine an entry, and then take that entry, and every entry beyond it, until the predetermined number of entries is reached. For example, if the ward in question has 3 entries in mid-afternoon, a single roll could produce a street scene with a merchant haggling with a customer, a group of children playing, and a wagon unloading supplies. If the encounter occurs after dark, add 20 to the percentile roll.

Roll a four-sided die for the number of entries to be used. Modify by the following information:

Time
Morning (Dawn to 10:00 AM)
Midday (10:00 AM to 4:00 PM)
Evening (4:00 PM to Dusk)
Night (Dusk to Midnight)
Witching Hour (Midnight to Dawn)

## Notes:

Most of the above are fairly self-explanatory, in particular since they are to provide "local color" for other encounters and player character actions. A few need further explanation below:

CITY GUARD: The "army" of Waterdeep, its members are 2d level fighters, wearing scale mail and shield (AC 5), armed with long swords, daggers, and darts laced with a paralytic agent (save against poison or be paralyzed 1-4 turns). Guard parties in Waterdeep usually have a leader (Sergeant) of 5th level.

CITY WATCH: Usually found in patrols of 4, consisting of two 1st level patrolmen, one armar (Sergeant) of 2 d level, and one civilar (Captain) of 3d level or higher. They are garbed in leather armor of green, black, and gold (AC 7). They carry stout rods of heavy wood (clubs in combat), daggers, and short swords.

INNOCENT BYSTANDERS: Common townsfolk without special ability, rank, or immediate purpose. Can be male or female, native or foreign, or of any race. They will tend to "not get involved" with any disturbance, and flee if directly threatened.

CONCERNED CITIZENS: These are like Innocent Bystanders, but if they witness any crimes or wrongdoing, will immediately try to summon the authorities, will lend aid to the
wounded, and otherwise help, unless this endangers their own lives. In cases of conflict, they will serve as witnesses.

TROTTING CARTS: A trotting cart is a two-wheeled carriage similar to the Earth's rickshaw, which carries up to two people comfortably. The carts are operated by the Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen, and cost 1 cp to travel anywhere in the city.

DUNGSWEEPERS: Streetcleaners, members of the Dungsweepers' Guild. They wear caps with orange and red feathers as badges of their craft. They carry brooms, shovels, rakes, and other instruments of destruction.

CRYERS: Cryers are the chief method of advertising and announcement in the Realms. Those for particular establishments declare the fineness of the product or services, while those for the city itself note some upcoming festival or important local news (a fine way of passing along information in the campaign). Cryers for noble families announce weddings, funerals, and births.

LAMPLIGHTERS: Only found in the city after dark, these are members of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters, noted by their black caps with a golden flame device on either side. Their job is to light a maintain the various iron-posted lamp bowls around the city. For a small gratuity they will also serve as guides through the city at night, providing light for travelers in need. If attacked, or threatened, they will flee, as most of the guild is quite young.

NOBLE IN PORTAGE CHAIR: Portage chairs are wheel-less litters carried by 2 or 4 servants, and are the travel medium of choice of older nobility and those unwilling to walk through the streets. A two-person chair carries one passenger, while a four-person chair carries four House Hothemer has a portage chair carried by two ogres, which carries two normal-size passengers, or the rather portly Malas Hothemer.

HARD CURRENCY GIRLS: Soiled doves. Ladies of the evening. Dance-hall girls with hearts of gold.

RUFFIANS and THUGS of various descriptions: Treat as 1st or 2d level fighters ( $50 \%$ chance each) armed with short swords, daggers, saps, and/or cudgel-like clubs.

MONSTER ENCOUNTERS: See page 25

# CREATING STATS AND BACKGROUND FOR "SCENIC CHARACTERS" 

These "scenic characters" are not intended to have deep involvements or long combats with the player characters, but there is always the chance that some interplay will occur. A thief may decide that an NPC noble looks a particularly inviting target for his pickpocket skills, or a paranoid PC fighter may think that those figures lurking in the shadows may be waiting for him.
Wizards, clerics, and other PC types have a level listing with their entry. Other characters encountered can use the table below.

| \% Roll | Level |
| :-- | :-- |
| $01-90$ | 0-level townsperson (1-6 hit points) |
| $91-97$ | 1-6 level character class (of type below) |
| $98-00$ | 1-10 level character class (of type below) |

Classes for special townsperson encounters
\% Roll Character Class and Notes
$01-40 \quad$ Fighter ( +1 to hit from strength)
$41-50 \quad$ Cleric
$51-70 \quad$ Magic-User
$71-00 \quad$ Thief ( +1 to AC from Dexterity)
Armor class is normally determined by description: those listed as Mercenaries will have heavier armor than those entries listed as Merchants.
Finally, there is a $60 \%$ chance that a special character will have a magical item of some type conforming to his class, and a $40 \%$ chance that having one, he will have a second. These items will be chosen by the DM for the encounter from the magic lists (no random rolls) with the following criteria:

1) The items are easily concealed or normal looking for that character type (a mercenary may have magical plate mail, but a merchant, on whom it would look decidedly different, would not).
2) The item should be one the DM is familiar with (shy away from items that require a lot of research, have a number of options, and need a lot of cross-checking).
3) The item should be one that the DM is prepared to let fall into the hands of the PC without unbalancing play. ("Look, Phred, the magic-user had a sphere of annihilation in his pocket. Lucky us!")

## Looking for People

When looking for a particular type of character (merchant, trotting cart, errand-runner, rich noble), there is a $10 \%$ chance that "type" is readily available. If a thief PC sits in front of a bar, looking for a rich "mark", or a newly-robbed fighter comes barrelling into the street looking for the Watch, there is a $10 \%$ chance that the rich "mark" or the Watch is within hailing distance,
If the PC stays in one place, there is a $10 \%$ chance per turn that the type of individual being sought will saunter by. If the character "goes looking" out on the streets (and takes a chance with encounters), this rises to $20 \%$ per turn.
Characters can never go searching for Monster Encounters. They are not that cooperative.

## Random Encounters in The City

Random encounters differ from the "Street Scenes" in a number of ways. First, the street scenes are window dressing, which the player characters can interact with, but are not required to respond to.

Two merchants arguing in the street is a slice of urbanized life, but not something that will bring the characters directly into conflict unless they so choose it.
City encounters can be defined in two types: friendly and unfriendly. A friendly encounter can be a character seeking a favor, greeting the player characters, offering them a drink, passing on information (even bad news) or other, general positive matters. Unfriendly encounters include, rowdies, drunks, bullies, characters of radically different alignments or attitudes, and all "Monster" encounters. Encounters that would be considered "Neutral", having no interest in the characters one way or the other, would be covered under the Street Scenes section. For example, a wizard who may actively befriend or hire the party would be an encounter, as would one attacking from out of the blue. A wizard from the street scenes would have no interest one way or the others with the PCs (though that may change depending on their actions towards him).

## Typical Encounters

Many are detailed in FR1, Waterdeep and the North, and are not repeated here, nor are they added to our "typical table." It should be noted that the chances of encountering the Lord of Waterdeep, Piergeiron Paladinson, is equivalent to having a monster encounter in the middle of the Way of the Dragon at noon!

Friendly or unfriendly character class encounters have a $40 \%$ chance of being individuals, otherwise having 1-10 comrades readily available for a fight. These comrades can be of the same class as the individual ( $30 \%$ chance) of general 3d level, or be merely ruffians and brigands (fighters or thieves, your choice), of 2 d level the rest of the time.

Note most houses in Waterdeep (at least the stone ones) are made with a mortar that prevents magical entrance, and backed up by clerical wards (enhanced yearly by the local temples at a reasonable fee) to deter all but the most determined monsters and undead. No protection is perfect, however, and anyone who has gone out of his or her way to offend the undead natives of Waterdeep may awaken one evening with said creature standing at the foot of his or her bed.

The sighting of a beholder on the docks of Waterdeep three winters ago resulted in four weeks of turmoil, at the end of which it was determined that the entire affair was a hoax. Such encounters do occur in Waterdeep, as the bulk of the Undermountain is still unexplored, but they are very, very rare.)

# RECURRENT SITUATIONS 

One handy device for DMs running city encounters is to create a stable of recurrent NPC situations. This "supporting cast" can appear throughout a party's stay in a city, giving the setting a sense of continuity, and also as a jumping-off place for further adventures. These recurrent situations can be used as comic relief, as a delaying device to slow down player characters, or if a full-blown encounter would slow down play too much. Care should be taken not to overuse such "schticks"they are provided solely for entertainment, and should not outweigh the player character's own adventures.

Some useful tricks and schticks to use in Waterdeep include:
THE KNOWLEDGABLE STREET VENDOR: This bit of local color is often heard before he is seen, pushing his cart through the cobblestone streets of Waterdeep, bellowing at the top of his lungs, "CRAN-BERRIES! BREAD-FRUIT! GET YUIR RRRRADDISHES!" The street vendor peddles whatever fruit and vegetables he can get his hands on. More importantly, he is a gossip-monger of the first water, and knows most of the business of the day in Waterdeep. This makes him an excellent guide, as he can point the characters in the right direction. ("Oh, its outfitting a caravan you want? Have you tried the Gentle Rest stables for your mounts? Good prices, but the previous owners might not know they're gone yet!") The street vendor has a great deal of street-level knowledge, which he will be all-toowilling to pass onto others. If the characters become friendly with him, he will take their association as a close one, hailing them from across busy streets so all know they are around, and telling everyone else how great a fighter (cleric/mage, etc.) a particular PC is.
THE RAGGEDY PRIEST: A low-level (3d or 4th) cleric of some minor saint or lesser-known religion (perhaps one bordering on a cult), this poorly-dressed individual is out looking for believers. He acts like he has been hit by a feeblemind spell one time too many,
and maintains a non-stop torrent of catch-phrases, sayings, and religious proverbs (not all of them being appropriate for the moment). The DM can leave him in the crowd as a speaker haranguing the citizenry to straighten up, fly right, and engage in a regular program of dental hygiene. Or, the DM can be cruel and choose one of the PCs as a potential apostle or would-be convert. Who knows, in a few years the raggedy priest's faith could have its own temple in Waterdeep.
THE OFFICIAL: A nuisance encounter, this is a by-the-book low-level official of the city government who, given the time, will make an individual's life miserable with a continual barrage of petty complaints ranging from littering to failure to keep a weapon peace-bonded. He will write citations in unreadable handwriting, the only legible part being the amount charged (never more than 10 gp ). Surprisingly, the Official gives all of the money he collects to the City Government, and is recognized as a fullfledged arm of its collection bureau. Play him for comic relief, or to infuriate that chaotic-aligned player character. Try to avoid getting him killed; it may be wise to keep a detachment of the Watch nearby.
THE DRUNKEN GIANTS: This should start with a night encounter, where the party runs into a gang of 3-5 (depending on the strength of the PCs) hill giants, drunk beyond belief, bellowing at the top of their lungs. They have large, semi-full kegs under their arms, which they can hurl as boulders if need be. The largest one challenges a PC to a "fair fight" (no weapons or magic, use the Unarmed Combat Tables in Unearthed Arcana). Losing to the giant will result in a few lost hit points and damaged pride (the giant will be cautious not to kill a PC in town), while beating him will result in the others immediately adopting the PC as a member of their band and insisting that he or she come along to join them. Giants are very rarely seen in Waterdeepthese are the bodyguards of a young
giant princeling, who is in town engaged in careful negotiation about setting up civilized ties between the city and his people's fortress-villa. Killing the giants would result in a diplomatic incident (speak with dead spells would reveal the killers), and punishment would be swift (paying to raise the dead, plus a mission to aid the giants). The hill giants mean no harm, and are friendlier than their wilder brothers to the north. The bodyguard only gets to carouse when the princeling has gone to bed, and so they will be seen over the next month or two on the streets, or singing lusty songs in various bars.
THE SAGA OF JANSZOBUR: Janszobur is described in full on page 52 of FR1, Waterdeep and the North. He is a 4th level barbarian of the Snow Cat Nomads, who is on a quest to find a warrior-priestess who will (legend says) lead his people to greatness. He is relentless (if slightly inebriated) in his quest, and will try to enlist the PCs in his aid. Of course, his approach is to break down available doors, looking for his "War Queen." If the DM wishes to pursue the matter fully, Janszobur may find his War Queen among the PCs, or with the PCs help. Travel to his peoples camp should be long and dangerous, and capped with a "trial of worthiness" - battle with some beast such as a remorhaz.
THE DANCING BEAR: Another street entertainer, this time an accordionplayer with a dancing bear. The pair are usually seen, squealing and dancing, as passers-by toss them money. They will seek to step into any situation where wrong-doing seems to be occurring, and will summon the Watch if things go badly. Elestar, the accordion player, seems very capable and his bear, Hansel, incredibly intelligent, able to understand human speech. This is because Elestar is a 10th level ranger, and Hansel his friend and ally, a werebear. Do not let the players in on this, but the pair may provide a service as "guardian angels" for PCs who are in situations over their heads.

## PICKING POCKETS

## Short Version

Occasionally PCs will find it in their interest to check out what is in the pockets of a non-player character. This is often the result of removing their belonging from pockets, cutting purse-strings, or checking the bodies of the unconscious or deceased.
Most NPCs will have 1-6 items from the table below. Add 1 to the die roll for NPCs found in the North and Sea Wards, subtract 1 from the die roll for those in the Dock Ward (even most nobles know not to carry their life-savings in this rough neighborhood).

## \% Roll Item

97-98 Valuable message

## SPECIAL ITEMS

These are selected solely by the DM, and include treasure maps, important messages or information, and magical items. They will be often trapped, warded, or otherwise protected from theft. A gem of seeing for example, may be in a small locked box with a magic mouth placed upon it, programmed to shout "Thief!" if anyone but the owner touches it.

## Picking Pockets-Long Version

The following tables should be used for predetermined characters, or in situations where a large-scale delineation will not slow down play. Note that many items here may proved to be useful in a combat or thieving situation. THIS IS NOT a treasure table, to be rolled after the combat is resolved, but should be used BEFORE character action.

Decide which of these categories the potential victim(s) in question belong to:
Merchant
Craftsman
Laborer
Mercenary
Warrior
Farmer
Errand-runner
Knave
Noble
Beggar
Each of these categories is briefly described hereafter, and for each the combination of tables to roll on is given. DMs should roll twice or more on each table, or choose specific items from the tables.

Merchant: including all independent operators engaged in trade and commerce, including moneylenders and-moneychangers, ferrymen, and tavernmasters. It does not include craftsmen (see below).

Craftsman: Craftsmen and women are those who earn a living by skilled handiwork of some sort, independently or in the service of another. This includes smiths, coopers, harness-makers, tanners, potters, carpenters, masons, wood carvers, wagon-makers, and magic-users.

Laborer: This category takes in all presently-employed individuals who earn a living by the strength of their bodies, performing some unskilled or routine task not requiring complex training. This includes miners, farmhands, dock men, and all other loaders and unloaders of goods, and those who dig graves, pits, trenches, and the like.

Mercenary: This category includes all hireswords, those independents who fight for the pay of any master rather than in the continuous service of only one. Mercenaries are generally better fighters than warriors (see below) but are almost always more poorly equipped. This category includes caravan guards; caravan masters are usually considered as merchants (see above) for belongings and warriors (see below) for armor and

weaponry.
Warrior: This category includes men-at-arms, the watch, and guards, sworn to the service of an individual, family, or guild. The bodyguards of nobles and other important personages fall into this category.

Farmer: This category includes all who independently (or, for a fee, working the land of another absent individual) earn their living by raising produce on the land. Farmhands are considered laborers (see above); their masters are farmers. This category includes independent drovers and herdsmen.

Errand-Runner: This category includes messengers, servants, and the apprentices and assistants to all the above categories; they are generally younger and less well-trained than their masters/employers.

Knave: This catch-all category includes jobless persons: hangers-on, roust-abouts, street youths, ruffians, thugs, and thieves, the "rabble" of any settlement.

Noble: This category includes gentry, envoys and dignitaries of churches, (including clerics) guilds, and state, and visiting VIPs. The actual wealth, dress, or even presence of this category at all will vary according to your world and the specific location; it is suggested that the DM make deliberate selections from tables rather than rolling randomly.

Beggar: This category includes diseased (e.g., with leprosy) and disabled persons, those forced to beg. (Able-bodied, sham beggars should be considered as knaves.)

# CITY SYSTEM 

It is called the City of Splendors: Waterdeep, most populous and powerful of the cities of North. It is a city of wealth, adventure, and danger. More men have died in its taprooms and bars than in all the seiges of Dragonspear Castle. Success and death lurk in its shadowed entranceways and dimly-lit streets.

Come explore the greatest city of the Realms in this incredible new boxed set dealing with urban fantasy adventures. Waterdeep is detailed in no less than 10 expanded maps, embellished with typical building interiors suitable for use in any campaign setting. In addition, a full-size poster of Waterdeep is provided, along with a grand-scale three-dimensional map of Castle Waterdeep, hub of the city's government.

In addition to all these maps, a 32-page City System booklet provides encounters and street scenes, special features and details of Waterdeep, and methods for creating types of buildings in moments and filling the pockets of those unfortunate enough to get in a player character's way. Designed for use with Waterdeep, these new features are suitable for use anywhere in the Forgotten Realms!

It's all here-all you add is your imagination.

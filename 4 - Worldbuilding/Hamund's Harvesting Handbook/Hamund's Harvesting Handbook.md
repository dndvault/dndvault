# CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 

![img-0.jpeg](assets/Hamund's%20Harvesting%20Handbook_img-0.jpeg)
elcome dear reader to Hamund's Harvesting Handbook, written by none other than I, Hamund Holderhek! But who am I you ask?

Well, I am an adventurer at heart, a writer by passion, and a harvester at trade. I have travelled the many planes of the multiverse in search of adventure and story (for more of those stories, pick up any copy of "Hamund's Harrowing Histories I-XXXV")

Through my life I have fought and defeated just about every kind of creature you can imagine: I have tussled with treants, skirmished with sphinxes, and even engaged in fisticuffs with a fomorian or two. Never being one to let something go to waste, I always took my trusty hunting knife to these creatures and had a look to see what they had to offer. I have spent many years writing down my findings and anecdotes, and I now present them to you less seasoned adventurers so you may soak in my wisdom.

Yes, what you hold in your hands right now is a helpful guide to harvesting the creatures that a typical adventurer may face. You'll learn not just how valuable a roc's guts are, but also which way to twist your knife in order to extract them. The natural world is filled with riches just waiting for bold people like us to take them!

Good luck and good harvesting,
-Sir Hamund Holderhek, O.B.H. (First Class), V.A., N.K.P.

## Aim of this Guide

Let's be honest, every Dungeon Master has faced this exact problem at least once: their players have just finished killing a fearsome monster, and their first reaction is to slice it apart for loot. Now there's nothing wrong with this of course, but it can be a bit harrowing for a DM to not just come up with useful monster parts on the spot, but to also provide an interesting description, a monetary value, and a use for that part.

This book aims to act as a handy reference for the DM's that find themselves in this very situation. It provides a loot table for every single unique monster in the 5th Edition Monster Manual. These loot tables are easy to reference and contain every piece of information your players could need when they tear their fresh kills apart. It also possesses over 200 new and unique craftable items to be made from your harvesting adventures, and all the information you would need for them. There are of course rules for both the harvesting and the crafting, and a few extra goodies strewn in here too.

Everything has been written with balance in mind, but you are of course free to rebalance anything in this guide to suit your own table, or feel free to message me at drifters@ameworkshop@gmail.com or hit me up on Twitter @drifterworkshop to discuss anything in this guide.

# Chapter 2: How to Harvest 

![img-1.jpeg](assets/Hamund's%20Harvesting%20Handbook_img-1.jpeg)
he act of removing useful body parts from a creature is referred to as harvesting. Anything that can be harvested from a creature is referred to as a harvesting material or simply material. In general, only creatures that have died may be harvested, but there may be some exceptions based on context.

This section details the steps associated with actually performing a harvest, and any factors that may influence it.

## Appraising

"My mother always used to press the importance of taking one's time and not jumping into things. This advice holds true whether one is harvesting a creature, engaging in a fight, or literally jumping into a river."
Hamund
Before a player begins hacking and butchering their hunt, they may instead choose to take a moment first and appraise the creature to be harvested. To do this, they must spend 1 minute examining the creature to be harvested and then roll an Intelligence check, adding their proficiency bonus if they are proficient in the skill corresponding to that creature (see table below). For example, appraising a Beholder (which is an aberrant), the check would be an Intelligence (Arcana) check, while appraising an Ogre (which is a giant) would require an Intelligence (Medicine) check.

The DC of the check is equal to $\mathbf{8 +}$ the Harvested Creature's CR (treating any CR less than 1 as 0 ). Success on this check grants the player full knowledge of any useful harvesting materials on the creature, the DC requirement to harvest those materials, any special requirements to harvest them, and any potential risks in doing so. In addition, any harvesting check made on that creature by that player is rolled at advantage. A character may only attempt one appraisal check per creature.

## Monster Type/Skill Check

Creature Type Skill

Aberration Arcana
Beast Nature
Celestial Arcana
Construct Investigation
Dragon Nature
Elemental Arcana
Fey Arcana
Fiend Arcana
Giant Medicine
Humanoid Medicine
Monstrosity Nature
Ooze Investigation
Plant Nature
Undead Arcana

## Splitting Up the Responsibilities

Some party members may prefer to let one character handle the appraisal of materials, while another more dextrous character handles the actual harvesting. In this scenario, all benefits of appraising a creature are conferred to the player doing the harvesting, so long as the player that performed the appraising assists the harvesting player through the whole duration of the harvest.

## Harvesting

In order to harvest a creature, a character must make a Dexterity ability check using the same skill proficiency as listed in the above appraising table. For example, a character attempting a harvest check on an Aberrant would receive a bonus equal to their Dexterity modifier and their proficiency in Arcana (if they have any).

This check reflects a character's ability to not only properly remove the intended item without damaging it, it also involves any ancillary requirements of the harvest such as proper preservation and storage techniques.

## Using Other Proficiencies

If a player is harvesting a certain creature, or harvesting a creature of a certain type of material, the DM may allow them to use a relevant tool proficiency rather than a skill proficiency.

For example, the DM may allow a player to add their proficiency with Tinker's Tools to their attempt to harvest a mechanical golem or use their proficiency with leatherworking tools when attempting to harvest a creature for its hide. Alternatively, all creature type proficiencies may be replaced by proficiency with the harvesting kit.

Each individual item in a creature's harvesting table is listed with a DC next to it. Any roll that a player makes that equals or exceeds this DC grants that player that item. Rewards are cumulative, and a player receives every item with a DC equal to or below their ability check result. For example, rolling a total of 15 on a check to harvest an azer will reward the player with both "azer ash", and "azer bronze skin", but not a "spark of creation". If they so wish, players may opt to not harvest a material even if they have met the DC threshold to harvest it.

Only one harvesting attempt may be made on a creature. Failure to meet a certain item's DC threshold assumes that the item was made unsalvageable due to the harvester's incompetence.

For most creatures, the time it takes to harvest a material is counted in minutes and is equal to the DC of that material divided by 5 . For huge creatures however, it is equal in DC of that material, while for gargantuan creatures, it is equal to the DC of that material multiplied by 2 .

## PARTIGULARLY VIOLENT DEATHS

"I know that it is a dangerous world out there, and we all must do what we can to survive. But do understand that there are few people out there that are in the market for a charred owlbear pelt with more holes in it than the plot of a bad novel."

- Hamund

This guide assumes that most creatures you attempt to harvest died in direct combat and thus already accounts for the idea that you are harvesting creatures that are not in pristine condition. However, some deaths are more violent than others and can make harvesting useful materials either extremely difficult or downright impossible. Such examples include burning by fire, dissolving from acid, or being completely crushed under a pillar of stone. In these cases, raise the DC for harvesting any of that creature's materials by 5 . Alternatively, the DM may decide that wellorchestrated hunts result in a carcass that is prime for harvesting, such as creatures killed mostly through psychic damage, or those killed in one clean attack. In these cases, the DM should lower the DC for harvesting any of that creature's materials by 5 .

Furthermore, the DM may adjudicate whether or not some of a creature's individual materials have been made useless due to effects imposed by them in the course of their death. Examples may include blood being tainted from poisoning, or their pelt being worthless due to excessive slashing/piercing damage.

## Optional Rule: CarcASs DEGRADATION

This guide mostly assumes that harvesting takes place on a freshly killed corpse and that little to no decomposition has yet occurred. However, in some cases, a player may desire to harvest a creature that has been dead for quite a while. In these cases, the DM may declare that certain body parts have already withered away and become unharvestable or may decide to increase the DC's of all harvestable materials as if the creature had died a particularly violent death. If corpse decomposition is too advanced, it is entirely within the DM's right to deny harvesting the creature altogether.

As a quick guide, the following timeline may be observed to decide on decomposition levels:

- 1 hour after death: The carcass' hide has ruptured from bloating and has become useless.
- 1 day after death: The carcass' blood has become too tainted to be useful, and soft tissues like the eyes have putrefied.
- 3 days after death: The carcass' internal organs have decomposed
- 7 days after death: The carcass has undergone extensive purification and none of its soft tissue remains harvestable.
- Note: Harder materials like bones, teeth, claws, and hair do not generally undergo decomposition and will remain usable indefinitely.

# Chapter 3: The Harvest Tables 

![img-3.jpeg](assets/Hamund's%20Harvesting%20Handbook_img-3.jpeg)
fter countless autopsies, vivisections, experiments, and just plain butchering. I have amassed what is most likely the most complete set of knowledge regarding the anatomies, uses, and values of the wondrous creatures that inhabit our worlds. I now present this knowledge (as well as some rather choice anecdotes) to you, dear reader. -Hamund

## Understanding the Tables

Every unique monster from the Monster Manual has been listed in this book with an associated harvest table. When your players attempt a harvest, simply look up the relevant monster in this guide and read out the results (monsters are listed in the same order as in the Monster Manual). The following is an explanation of how to read the table.

## DC

This is the DC required to harvest this item. Any harvesting check that equals or exceeds this threshold allows the player that made that check to succsessfully harvest that item.

## ITEM

The name of the item received. While for most items, the player only receives one of the listed item, some item names have parentheses next to them. These indicate the amount that a player receives upon a successful harvest e.g.: Aarakocra Feather (small pouch) or Aboleth Mucus (3 vials). At the DM's discretion however, they may adjudicate that a player receives less or more than the stipulated quantity. Such reasons may include extremely high success on a roll, or certain methods in which the creature was killed.

## Optional Rule: Harvesting DANGEROUS Materials

Harvesting some creatures are more dangerous than others. While most creatures are harmless once killed, others possess poisons, acids, and breath sacks that remain active even after the creature's death. Even worse is that a simple misplaced knife stroke or errant twitch of the hand can lead to these materials accidentally harming the harvester.

Under this optional rule, whenever a harvester rolls below the DC of a harvestable material that has a "Use" section that deals damage, the material is not just lost, it also expends its ability on the harvester. For example, a character that fails to properly harvest a poison would suffer the effect of that poison on themselves, or a character that fails to harvest a breath sack would release the effect of that breath sack in their direction. The exact adjudication of the failure result may change depending on the DM.

## DESCRIPTION

A brief description of the item to be harvested, written by Hamund. While this is usually just for flavour, some items also have a "Use" section. These items may be used immediately after being harvested and require no further adjustments or crafting. Their function is described here in the description box.

Additionally, some materials have harvesting requirements beyond just steady hands and a sharp knife. Any extra requirements or criteria for harvesting a material will be listed here.

## Value

All materials are listed with their base resell value. This is how much money an average shopkeeper would be willing to pay for the materials in good conditions. DM discretion is advised when varying this value, dependant on shopkeeper mood, rarity within the setting, condition of the material, etc. A material with a value listed as "varies" indicates that its usage is too specific for it to be sold to an average shopkeeper, and the value of the material would depend heavily on context.

When items are harvested in discrete quantities, the value listed refers to each individual item. For example, Aboleth Mucus is harvested as a set of 3 vials, and so the value listed ( 20 gp ) refers to each individual vial (so successfully harvesting Aboleth Mucus would be worth 3 x $20 \mathrm{gp}=60 \mathrm{gp}$ ). When items are listed as indiscrete quantities however, the value listed refers to the entire quantity. For example, Aarakocra Feathers are harvested in the indiscrete quantity of a: "small pouch." Thus the 8 sp value listed refers to the value of a "small pouch of Aarakocra Feathers," not 8 sp for each individual feather.

## Value Factors

The values listed here are based on a myriad of factors including: CR of the monster, average treasure horde values, use in crafting, whether the monster tends to be found alone, whether the item is consumable, probability of successfully harvesting the item, balance around existing prices, and sometimes just for flavour. These prices are intended as a baseline only, and the DM is free to adjust these values as they see fit for their campaign. The DM is also to keep in mind that, although certain items may have high values, not all vendors may want to buy them. For example, although a Death Knight Heart may be worth the high price of $4,000 \mathrm{gp}$, it may be difficult to sell it to the village grocer. Sometimes, finding the right buyer for an esoteric item can be an entertaining side quest in and of itself, or simply used as a good downtime activity.

---

## Weight

The weight of the item listed in pounds. The weight listed here follows the same rules as values do; the listed number refers to the weight of individual items, unless that item is harvested in indistinct quantities, in which case the weight refers to the whole indistinct quantity.

## Crafting

Some items, although valuable, require a skilled artisan to craft them into a usable item. The material's description details which item they can be crafted into. If this section is blank, the item has no craftable item associated with it.

The section of crafted items at the end of this book details the usage of crafted items, as well as details on their crafting requirements. Some craftable items originate from published source books from WotC. These receive special tags in brackets that denote which book they come from. For more information on crafting visit Chapter 4.

## Humanoid Trinket Tables

"In general, humanoids do not yield much in the way of harvestable materials. Partly this is just the negative relationship that humanoid evolution has with innate magical abilities, but mostly it's just because polite society frowns upon butchering things that look vaguely like themselves."
-Hamund
Most humanoids listed in this book do not possess many useful materials to harvest. In order to complement the relatively bare tables of humanoids, a separate table is listed in their section describing items that may be plundered off of these creatures. These items tend to be random trinkets and are not weapons or armour. More often than not, they are relatively useless and are intended only to be used for resale.

There is no ability check required to pilfer these trinkets, and the DM is free to decide which of these trinkets can be found on a typical corpse (if any at all). These tables are intended to be largely used as DM inspiration and to sate the lust of loot-hungry players while avoiding the ghoulish activity of dismembering a humanoid corpse.

Like all harvested items, the value and weight listed refers to 1 unit of the respective item in that row.

# Harvest Table: A 

## Aarakogra

"Aarakocra are an interesting folk. As stoic and flighty as the birds they resemble, they nevertheless make good company when coaxed down from their solitary perches. Interesting as well is that despite being very magical themselves, their wings are relatively useless for any sort of crafting. Perhaps the Wind Dukes of Aaqa realised that having servants everyone would want to hunt would be a bad idea."- Hamund

## DC Item Description

5 Aarakocra The large feathers of an aarakocra are enjoyed among some of the more Feathers ostentatious members of society as fun accessories and fashion highlights. If you (small can find a tailor willing to take them, you are sure to be able to earn at least a few pouch) silver for a good amount of them.
10 Aarakocra Aarakocra have an innate connection to the elemental planes that allows them to Heart summon air elementals when enough of them gather together. Burning their hearts in an offering can achieve much of the same effect but with less control over the temperament of the summoned elemental.
Use: When 5 different creatures within 30 feet of each other hold 5 different aarakocra hearts and spend their actions on three consecutive turns to burn the hearts, they may summon an air elemental in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of them. The burners must remain still while burning the hearts. This elemental is hostile to all creatures it can see around it, but any of the 5 creatures that summoned it can spend their action to try and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to direct the air elemental's hostility at a creature they can both see within 60 feet. The air elemental remains for 1 hour.

DC Item Description

10 Aboleth The razor sharp teeth that line the stinking maw of the aboleth are each as large as 20 gp 15 lb . Teeth a human's forearm and twice as thick. While too unwieldy and crooked to turn (large into a weapon, more exotic merchants would pay a tidy sum to turn them into bag) decorations and trinkets.
15 Aboleth Aboleths demand service and obsequience, even going so far as to warp the Mucus creatures around themselves to suit their domain. While the transformative mucus (3 vials) that surrounds the aboleth tends to dissipate quickly after their death, swift harvesters can bottle some of it for use in alchemy projects later.
20 Aboleth Larger than a normal creature's head. Removed from its skull and ever unblinking, Eye it still seems to see more than most mortals ever will.
25 Aboleth The power of the aboleth lies not in its many tentacles, but in its brain. Even now Brain and then, when you hold it long enough, you swear you can hear whispers of Lobe forgotten history in the corner of your mind.

---

# ANGELS 

"I have never claimed to be a saint myself, and in my pursuit of rare game and hunts I will admit that I have drawn the ire of more than one angel. While tussling with an angel is a risky proposition, harvesting one is even worse as it comes with the risk of ticking off their celestial patron. But then again, if you've gone far enough down the dark path to kill an angel, you've probably already committed yourself to being on the wrong side of a god's attention."-Hamund

While an angel's parts may be useful, harvesting a good-aligned angel is considered a universally evil act. Most good-aligned gods will condemn any character that perpetuates such a thing, even if the angel being harvested was not theirs. As such, any character attempting to harvest or attune to an item made from an angel that is still in service to a good-aligned god has a 30 per cent chance of being inflicted with the curse of the fallen.

While inflicted with the curse of the fallen, a creature becomes vulnerable to radiant damage and any magical healing that comes from a good-aligned cleric or paladin automatically fails when used on the cursed character. This curse can only be removed if the cursed character spends 24 hours in a vigil at a temple of the god of the angel who they attempted to harvest or whose part they attempted to attune to. After these 24 hours, a follower of that god may then cast the spell remove curse to end the curse.

## DEVA

DC Item Description
10 Deva The blood of an angel flows with radiant energy that brings life to all it touches (it Blood clearly didn't work hard enough for its original owner though). Many of the most ( 3 desperate people actively seek angels in an attempt to harvest their blood as a vials) panacea, without putting much thought into the worse fate that awaits them should they succeed.
Use: When you drink this blood, you regain $4 \mathrm{~d} 8+2$ hit points and are freed from any curse (except the curse of the fallen), disease, poison, blindness, and deafness.
15 Deva There is perhaps nothing more distinctive than the sillhouette of glorious white angel Wing wings against a radiant light. As some of the most powerful magical wings in all the (x2) planes, these make for almost perfect base materials for the ever-useful wings of flying.

20 Deva The alabaster white skin of a deva gleams in the morning sun, and a single glance of its Skin beatuty has been known to turn sinners from their paths of evil. If you are not one of those people however, you may take this skin and use it to simulate some of the miraculous abilities inherent in these angels.

## Planetar

DC Item Description
5 Planetar A planetar is known for its ability to hear lies whenever they are spoken. Their ears Ear (x2) carry on this trait even in death and can be seen twitching when falsehood passes through them.
Use: While holding two of these ears, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) ability checks to detect a lie being spoken.
10 Planetar The blood of an angel flows with radiant energy that brings life to all it touches (it Blood clearly didn't work hard enough for its original owner though). Many of the most (3 vials) desperate people actively seek angels in an attempt to harvest their blood as a panacea, without putting much thought into the worse fate that awaits them should they succeed.
Use: When you drink this blood, you regain $6 \mathrm{~d} 8+3$ hit points and are freed from any curse (except the curse of the fallen), disease, poison, blindness, and deafness.
15 Planetar There is perhaps nothing more distinctive than the sillhouette of glorious white Wing angel wings against a radiant light. As some of the most powerful magical wings in (x2) all the planes, these make for almost perfect base materials for the ever-useful wings of flying.
25 Planetar The celestial bones of a planetar are stronger than steel and carry a charge of radiant Bone energy within them long after their owner's demise. While most radiantly infused weapons are designed to force evil creatures to scurry away, weapons forged from the ever-vigilant planetars are designed to keep evil creatures nearby, ensuring they meet their divine judgement.

# Solar 

DC Item Description
5 Solar A solar is known for its ability to hear lies whenever they are spoken. Their ears carry Ear on this trait even in death and can be seen twitching when falsehood passes through (x2) them.

Use: While holding 2 of these ears, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) ability checks to detect a lie being spoken.
10 Solar The blood of an angel flows with radiant energy that brings life to all it touches (it Blood clearly didn't work hard enough for its original owner though). Many of the most (3 desperate people actively seek angels in an attempt to harvest their blood as a vials) panacea, without putting much thought into the worse fate that awaits them should they succeed.

Use: When you drink this blood, you regain $8 \mathrm{~d} 8+4$ hit points and are freed from any curse (except the curse of the fallen), disease, poison, blindness, and deafness.
15 Solar There is perhaps nothing more distinctive than the sillhouette of glorious white Wing angel wings against a radiant light. As some of the most powerful magical wings in (x2) all the planes, these make for almost perfect base materials for the ever-useful wings of flying.

25 Solar The burning gaze of a solar is capable of reducing even the strongest of evildoers to Eye a smoking mass of flesh on the ground. Taking these eyes and performing (x2) extraordinarily powerful magic on them can transform them into diamonds that shine the same way they did under the solar's control.

## Animated Objects

## Animated Armour

DC Item Description
10 Animating The basis of any animated object is the magical rune etched into its surface that Rune enchants it and brings it to life. While these runes cannot be transferred from one object to another, resourceful tinkerers are capable of salvaging some of the expensive powders and ashes used to make them, and thus they can be sold for a small bit of profit.

## Flying Sword

DC Item Description
10 Animating The basis of any animated object is the magical rune etched into its surface that Rune enchants it and brings it to life. While these runes cannot be transferred from one object to another, resourceful tinkerers are capable of salvaging some of the expensive powders and ashes used to make them, and thus they can be sold for a small bit of profit.

## Rug of Smothering

DC Item Description

15 Shimmer The fibers of an enchanted rug continue to carry on a special property to them Cloth even after being rendered inanimate. When looked upon, these fibers seem to glimmer and move ever so slightly without any outside force acting on them. This property has been noted by tailors that incorporate them into various vanity items like the amusing cloak of mending or cloak of billowing.

# ANKHEG 

DC Item Description
5 Ankheg Extremely hard, but too unwieldy and unconfortable to use in making armour. The Chitin ankheg's hide still finds some uses as a building material, especially for subterranean dwelllers who appreciate its suitability to rocky environments.
10 Ankheg A series of bladders in the hindquarters of an ankheg, this organ is analagous to the Gaster intestines of a humanoid. Although ankhegs are known for eating flesh, they absorb the majority of their nutrients from the soil they burrow through. Artificers are able to take this fact and create a handy survival tool for explorers with a strong stomach.
15 Ankheg Ankhegs are well known for their incredibly potent digestive fluids that dissolve their 4 gp 1 lb . Bile (2 prey. As such, alchemists find ankheg bile to be a particularly useful ingredient when vials) creating their own acidic concoctions.
Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a target within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against the target, treating the vial as an improvised object. On a hit, the target suffers 1d6 acid damage.

## AzER

DC Item Description
10 Azer Residual material from the azer's corpse. This ash still maintains a faint trace of Ash the magic that created it. While not overly useful, some artisans like to sprinkle it over their creations for good luck.
15 Azer Azers need no armour, as their skin is already made of durable, mastercrafted Bronze bronze. While the trauma of its owner's demise has made the skin difficult to Skin repurpose directly for armour, it is still high quality material, and any blacksmith worth their salt would be happy to get it.
20 Spark of Although the azer of this particular flame of creation is dead, a single Creation smouldering spark remains, and those with knowledge of the arcane are able to quickly harvest and store it safely for later use. While small, these sparks have immense potential and are often used in either the construction of living trinkets, or the lighting of magical forges. Requires enchanted vial.

# Harvest Table: B 

## BANSHEE

DC Item Description
15 Banshee The incorporeal banshee leaves very little behind except the last whispers of its Echo terrible wail. With some spirit paper, a good harvester can collect the echo of this wail before it vanishes forever and use it in times of desperation. Requires spirit paper.
Use: You may spend an action to tear this item open and release the banshee wail kept within. All creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature drops to 0 hit points. On a success, a creature takes 3d6 psychic damage. This wail has no effect on constructs and undead.
20 Banshee It takes a particularly nimble mind and fast action to trap enough remnants of a Remnant banshee to make a usable crafting item. If successful however, they are often refashioned into enchanted reeds that create a haunting noise when used in wind instruments. Requires spirit paper.

## BASILISK

DC Item Description
5 Basilisk As the basilisk feeds on stone, its teeth are infamous for being extraordinarily hard Tooth and sharp. Stonemasons across the land value these teeth as tools in theit craft. (small pouch)
10 Basilisk The petrifying gaze of the basilisk is known far and wide. As such, the eyes of a Eye ( $x 2$ ) basilisk are prized for their inherent magical properties and their use in the creation of petrifying tonics. It is said that more nefarious wizards make use of these eyes to create trapped statues that transform unwary intruders into stone.
15 Basilisk It is a common misconception that basilisks digest stone. In fact, the fluids inside the 6 gp 1 lb . Basiisk Bile (2 basilisk's gullet transform consumed stone back into organic matter to be consumed. vials) This bile is thus worth a good amount to alchemists seeking to make an oil to counter the effects of a basilisk's gaze.

## BEHIR

DC Item Description
10 Behir The scales of a behir resemble a dragon's but are different in many ways in the Scales eyes of a trained observer. While these scales are often found decorating items in an unscrupulous tailor's shop marketed as actual dragon scales, the fact that they are much smoother and more flexible than an actual dragon's makes them much more useful for fashion.
15 Behir The horn of a behir is composed of a unique keratin that has an odd reaction to Horn the presence of dragons. A dragon's mere presence causes these horns to resonate, usually alerting a behir to the presence of their hated foe. The horns will still function in the hands of anyone else, but the dragon usually must be much closer for the vibrations to be detected.
Use: When within 1 mile of a dragon (whether it in its true form or polymorphed into a different shape), this horn will begin to vibrate, with the vibrations becoming more pronounced the closer it is to the dragon. This horn does not indicate the direction of the dragon, only its general proximity.
20 Lightning This large, but surprisingly light leathery sack is located at the back of the behir's Sack cavernous mouth, and is roughly the size of a picnic basket. Inside is a mixture of chemicals, fluids and enzymes that when exposed to the open air, erupts in a destructive crackle of lightning. While extremely dangerous, alchemists and weaponsmiths alike will crawl over themselves to obtain some of this powerful energy.
Use: The lightning sack can be thrown by itself up to a range of 20 feet. If thrown, the lightning sack will explode on impact, dealing 4 d 10 lightning damage to all creatures in a 10 foot radius, or half that on a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw.

# BEHOLDERS 

"Beholders are an odd bunch and difficult to define in terms of harvesting. This is because no two beholders are ever similar, varying wildly in anatomy, colour, and appearance. Despite this, each one seems to think of themselves as being perfect in form. It boggles the mind, but you know what they say about beauty."-Hamund

## BEHOLDER

DC Item Description
15 Beholder The anatomy of a beholder is infinitely alien and strange to any scholar native to Membrum the Material Plane. One of the most curious features of the beholder is that aside from its brain, the beholder features a noticeable dearth of internal organs. Instead, any internal space not occupied by brain matter is filled with a large rubbery balloon that seems to act as the beholder's heart, lungs, and stomach. How it achieves all of these simultaneous functions is unknown. This organ is as versatile as its owner, and many scholars are eager to obtain a complete sample for their research into transmutation.
20 Beholder While the eye stalks of the beholder may be severed from its body, they still retain Eye Stalk some of the magical energy that allowed them to fire powerful rays at their enemies. Skilled artificers can take these stalks and use them as the cores of magical wands that emit the same types of rays they emitted in life. Alternatively, four of the intact stalks may be used as part of a ritual to summon a spectator.

If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll 1d10. The type of eye stalk they receive corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the beholder statblock.
25 Beholder The main eye of the beholder is unique in that instead of issuing forth a beam of Main Eye magical energy, it instead does the opposite: emitting a cone of nullification that disrupts the Weave and prevents the functioning of any magic it gazes at. While it is inactive due to being severed from a living beholder, learned wizards know how to transfigure this organ into an anti-magic crystal, the type that can be used to protect their own strongholds against magical incursions.

## Death Tyrant

DC Item Description
15 Death The teeth of a beholder must never be underestimated, even in death. Their jaws Tyrant possess a wicked bite, and when attached to the handle of an axe, so can your Jaw backswing.
25 Death The eye of a beholder undergoes a terrible transformation when it transitions into Tyrant undeath, emitting a cone of negative energy rather than anti-magic. But like a normal Eye beholder eye, this eye can be transformed into a crystal of great power that many powerful wizards enjoy employing in their lairs.

## Spectator

DC Item Description
15 Spectator The stalks of the spectator are less powerful than those of the beholder it Eye Stalk consumed to be summoned. However, their potential to be made into wands by artificers are the same. When crafted properly, they continue to contain an arcane charge that allows them to discharge the same types of magical rays they did in life.

If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll 1d4. The type of eye stalk they receive corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the spectator statblock.
20 Spectator The main eye of the spectator functions differently to that of the beholder. While Main Eye the beholder's emits an anti-magic cone at all times, the spectator's can be used to reflect poorly casted spells at other targets. When used for crafting, the magic of the eye can be transferred over to a shield, to grant it the same ability.

# Blights 

## Needle Blight

DC Item Description
5 Needles The signature needles of the needle blight. While not more particularly useful than (small any other needle you would find on the forest floor, some fletchers find they make bundle) reliable sturdy material for wooden darts.

10 Blight Most blights are incapable of speech as we understand it. Instead, they communicate Pollen with each other through the use of pollen that can be carried for miles. Alchemists (small and druids however have figured out how to repurpose this pollen for potions that pouch) allow the user to communicate with regular plant life.

15 Blight The rapid ability of the blights to spread their influence is well known to any forest Seeds dweller. They do this through the many seeds that each blight carries within them. (x5) These dry, wrinkled seeds sprout in a matter of hours and grow to maturity in days, forming the infamous vines, brambles, and weeds of a blight infestation. While most of their dark properties are lost if not planted by an actual blight, some alchemists are capable of repurposing them for a crop fertiliser or an oil that reacts strangely with plantlife.
20 Gulthias The bodies of blights exhibit a strange property. When large quantities are mulched Sap and then strained for some time, a few drops of a sticky, dark red sap sometimes (vial) drips out which more daring druids use in their rituals.

## Twig Blight

DC Item Description
15 Blight The rapid ability of the blights to spread their influence is well known to any forest Seeds dweller. They do this through the many seeds that each blight carries within them.

## Vine Blight

DC Item Description
5 Vines The signature vines of the vine blight. These have been made sturdier yet more (small flexible in order to constitute the blight's body. When stripped down to their fibers, bundle) they make good material for rope and ties.
10 Blight Unlike the needle blight which uses its pollen to communicate with other needle Pollen blights, the vine blight's pollen is capable of interacting directly with other plants, (small turning entire forests into dark defenders of the blight's domain. Despite that, their pouch) usage in alchemy is the same.

# BugbEARS 

"Bugbears, an annoying bunch and probably my least liked of all the goblinoid races. Their bodies yield little in terms of good harvest other than a few ears for the town guards to nail to their walls. Their satchels carry even less; most of it useless things a bugbear in its stupidity thought was valuable, or loot so poorly cared for it has lost any value." - Hamund

## Bugbear

DC Item Description
10 Bugbear Despite usually being filthy and riddled with mange, an intact bugbear hide can Hide actually serve as very good leather. It is not uncommon for more nomadic people to wear these tanned hides for both comfort and as a sign of their strength.

## Bugbear Chief

DC Item Description
10 Bugbear Despite usually being filthy and riddled with mange, an intact bugbear hide can Hide actually serve as very good leather. It is not uncommon for more nomadic people to wear these tanned hides for both comfort and as a sign of their strength.
15 Heart of The most fearsome of bugbears carry with them the blessing of their god Hruggek Hruggek which allows them to surge past any danger and debilitations. If you are willing to indulge in your own inner savage, you too can take this blessing by consuming the bugbear's heart, but beware of any side effects.
Use: You may spend an action to consume this heart. If you do so, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, stunned, or put to sleep for the next hour. Once this effect wears off, you must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion as the adrenalinne filled organ passes through your system.

## BULLYWUG

"Bullwyugs possess little of value, and what they do have will probably be of little value soon anyway. I dislike even pilfering the pockets of the bullywugs I defeat as everything they own inevitably becomes covered in a thin layer of slime." - Hamund

# Harvest Table: G 

## CAMBION

DC Item Description
5 Cambion Unlike most fiends, a cambion does not dissolve when it is slain. Its bizarre Sulfur physiology however does still react strangely on death with parts of its body (small spontaneously combusting as it dies. These reactions are not enough to destroy the pouch) body, but it does create small piles of sulfur that are quite useful in various demonology related projects.
10 Devil- As the child of a fiend and a human, the blood of a cambion possesses certain Tinged magical properties that are even more powerful due to their compatibility with Blood (3 humanoid physiology. vials)
15 Cambion As with many fiends, the wings of a cambion are useful in creating the famous item: Wing infernal wings. When taken whole, they can serve as a majority of the base, forming (x2) bat wings when the final item is put to use.

## CARRION CRAWLER

DC Item Description
10 Carrion As their name implies, carrion crawlers feast solely on putrid and rotting flesh. As Crawler disgusting as their digestive system may seem, it is uniquely adapted to overcoming Guts any diseases or poisoning that would befall any other creature attempting such a diet. Local healers have thus developed numerous uses for a carrion crawler's guts, ranging from a salve to treat gangrene, to a tonic for treating indigestion.
15 Carrion The mucus of a carrion crawler is remarkably poisonous, especially since it only Crawler requires contact with the skin to take effect.
Mucus Use: A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution (vial) saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

# CENTAUR 

"Centaurs are a fascinating bunch, and I have had the pleasure of living with a tribe for a prolonged time and getting to study their cultures. While others may see them as savage and uncivilised, they partake in wonderful games and acrobatics during their festivals. Indeed, as strange as the idea may be, I once saw a group of centaurs stacking themselves upon one another in a dizzyingly high tower! There are some wizards out there that have attempted to disprove my claim, stating that such an occurrence is ludicrous and impossible given a centaur's anatomy, but I swear on my life it is true."- Hamund

## DC Item Description

10 Centaur The hooves of a centaur are much harder than those of a mundane horse, and Hoof centaurs in their pragmatism have even been found harvesting them for their own (x4) use. It is not uncommon for centaurs to be in the possession of tools, bowls, and even weapons made from the hooves of their dead tribal members.

15 Centaur The hairs of a centaur are renowned for their tensile strength while remaining Tail supple and flexible. As such they make superb bowstrings and centaur archers are known for using their own hairs in their bows.

(x2)
15 Chimera One of the chimera's three heads. Larger than a regular goat's, the horns are Goat particularly hard and large. Many mountain folk consider an ale mug made from a Head chimera's horns to be a very enticing gift.

15 Chimera The leonine front paws of the chimera. Larger than a normal lion's, with claws twice Lion as sharp. Some druids prefer using these as their focus when performing Paw transmutation magic, believing that it makes their spellwork easier. Whether that is (x2) true or not has yet to be confirmed.

20 Chimera One of the chimera's three heads. Larger than a regular lion's, this head makes a Lion fantastic trophy when stuffed and mounted, particularly when placed in the quarters Head of a skittish house guest.

20 Chimera The draconic wings of the chimera. While they lack the same amount of magical Dragon power as a genuine dragon's wings, they are also much easier to handle and much Wing easier to get a hold of. Daring tinkers have taken to using them in making kites (x2) strong enough to lift smaller races high into the air.

25 Chimera One of the chimera's three heads. While the flame is less powerful than a genuine Dragon dragon's, the glands that produce the flame is much easier to access in a chimera's Head head, and provide materials that are much more stable to work with. Alchemists prize these glands as a source of highly flammable oil.

# Chuul 

DC Item Description
10 Chuul The oversized pincer of a monstrous chuul. While too unwieldy to be fashioned into Pincer a useful weapon, the razor sharp hooks can be repurposed for useful tools, including, (x2) but not limited to, instruments of torture.

15 Chuul A rather nasty toxin, wringed from the tentacle appendages of the chuul. Venom Unfortunately, the death of its owner causes it to lose much of its potency but can (vial) still be used as a base by knowledgable alchemists to create another paralysing potion.
20 Arcana At the base of a chuul's brain lies a peculiar bundle of nerves referred to as the Ganglia arcana ganglia. This highly sensitive lobe vibrates in the presence of magic and is what grants chuul's their innate ability to sense magic around them. Designed by their aboleth masters through generations of magic and breeding, there are only a handful of artificers in the world capable of repurposing it into a functioning tool capable of replicating the chuul's natural ability.

## CLOAKER

DC Item Description
10 Cloaker Resembling the needle-like teeth of a moray eel but stronger, the teeth of the Tooth cloaker can be used to make a variety of tools. Some of the more notorious (small thieves in the world even boast possessing lockpick sets made entirely of pouch) cloaker teeth.
15 Cloaker The infamous cloaker tail, covered in dozens of razor sharp spines. Drow Tail taskmasters have developed a technique of taking the tails, treating them with special oils, and reusing them as whips.
20 Cloaker Even for the most experienced of tanners, the skin of the cloaker is Hide exceptionally difficult to remove. Due to the cloaker's unique physiology, a single misplaced cut can cause the creature's internal enzymes to spill and stain the hide. If done correctly however, the skin will maintain its shadowy and illusive appearance and may be used as the foundation for the ever useful cloak of displacement.

# Cookatrice 

DC Item Description
10 Cockatrice Unlike basilisks, a cockatrice cannot consume stone. Unfortunately, anything that 2 sp 1 lb . Bile (vial) receives so much as a graze from its beak becomes petrified, and with the cockatrice's frenzied hunting style, such an occurrence is more then common. As such, its bile has certain properties that slow down the petrification process, allowing the cockatrice to get some nourishment before its food becomes undigestible. This bile has become a staple of a stonemason's toolkit as it allows them to temporarily soften stone for easier handling.
15 Cockatrice Cockatrices are infamous for their enthusiasm in devouring a meal, and as such, Droppings they occasionally end up swallowing food that they have already accidentally (small petrified. The food remains stone through the cockatrice's digestive system, and pouch) some consider the resulting food statues to be a novelty to say the least. There are even some enterprising individuals who keep cockatrice farms in order to harvest their droppings for stone trinkets (I assume they do not reveal to their customers where they came from however).
20 Cockatrice The infamous beak of a cockatrice, capable of turning any living creature into Beak petrified stone. Despite common belief, the petrifying magic has nothing to do with the cockatrice's saliva, but is entirely within the cockatrice's beak alone. Any artificer worth their salt knows the techniques to turn an undamaged beak into a weapon that shares the cockatrice's petrifying ability.

## COUATL

DC Item Description
15 Couatl The venom of a couatl is entirely non-lethal, reflective of the couatl's pacifist nature. Venom Couatl are in fact known for occasionally secreting this venom for the mortals they (vial) partner with in the hopes of averting deaths wherever possible.
Use: Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing melee weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next 10 minutes, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, or become poisoned for 24 hours. Until this poison ends, the target is unconscious. A creature automatically wakes up if they receive damage or if an adjacent creature spends their action to wake them up.
20 Couatl The feathers of a couatl are extraordinarily vibrant, yet as soft as down. A particular Feather pillow has been made with these feathers that shares the couatl's ability to shield its (large mind from external psychic threats. Powerful people have been known to use these bag) pillows to shield their sleeping moments from intrusion, as well as to just get an extremely comfortable sleep.

## Crawling Claw

DC Item Description
10 Cursed The bones of a hand that has been transformed by necromantic Knucklebones manipulation are notable for still carrying trace elements of those same energies. They are not useful for much, but it is said that a set of dice carved from these knucklebones roll lower than is statistically likely, giving rise to the ubiquitous unlucky gambler term: "the dead man's hand."

## CyCLOPS

DC Item Description
10 Cyclops The enormous lid of a cyclops is made of a strange material, quite different to the Eyelid rest of the cyclops' skin. The purpose of this is still a mystery, but various crafters have managed to take its esoteric properties and use it for their own entertaining projects.
15 Cyclops The extremely large heart of a cyclops. Makes a good trophy when preserved and Heart mounted on a base.
20 Cyclops Once they are roused to interest, cyclopses are known to relentlessly pursue Eye whatever it is they set their eye on. Experiments on cyclops remains have revealed that the eye itself is partly to blame, as its unique situation forces the cyclops to focus on one thing for prolonged periods of time. Artificers have taken this property and applied it into a battle aid that doubles as a stylish dinner party accessory.

# Harvest Table: D 

## DARKMANTLE

DC Item Description
10 Darkmantle Anybody who has been attacked by a darkmantle can attest to the suction power 5 sp 1 lb . Sucker of its tentacles. Reliable even beyond the death of its owner, many Underdark (small residents have adapted these suckers to be used for medical tools and other pouch) implements.
15 Darkmantle A bony structure on the inside of a darkmantle's head that acts as its ear. Skilled Otolith artificers can use this to create a variety of audio enhancing magical items.

## Death Knight

DC Item Description
15 Blighted When the flesh of a defeated death knight is burned in a ritual fire, the resulting Ash ashes retain the same dark aura of its original form. If one has the resolve for it, (small these ashes can be mixed with oils and special powders then applied to the pouch) body to gain certain protections from the undead.
Use: You may mix these ashes with 20 gold pieces worth of rare oils and powdered gems to create a paste that grants certain defences against undead when rubbed into the body. For 24 hours after using it on yourself, undead creatures have disadvantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks made to find you. In addition, you gain resistance to any necrotic damage dealt from an undead source and advantage on any saving throw imposed by an undead creature.
20 Cursed Blood is a generous term to apply to the coagulated muck that cloys in a death Blood knight's veins. Blacker than the cursed warrior's soul, this substance makes for a (3 vials) versatile reagent in certain desecration rituals and blood curses. Use with caution.
25 Death Even though a death knight may fall in battle, its dark curse will eventually form Knight a new body somewhere and force its soul to continue its mockery of life. If one Heart takes its heart and preserves it in a secret ritual, the death knight's new body will be formed without the organ. From then on, the missing heart can be used as a method of tracking the death knight, beating whenever it senses its old master nearby.

## DEMILICH

20 Demilich Smoke (vial) insignificantly small fraction of the demilich's true essence, but if bottled and stored properly, can be turned into an item to track the demilich wherever it may reappear. Requires enchanted vial.
25 Soul The demilich disciples of Acererak practice a particularly notorious necromantic Gem magic: inserting soul gems into their empty eye sockets to steal the spirits of (Acererak their victims. While taking the gem away from a defeated demilich is simply a disciple matter of picking it up, turning it over to your own control is considerably harder Demilich and requires a complicated ritual soon after the demilich's defeat.

# DEMONS 

"Demons are a nasty bunch, and even nastier to harvest. Looking past the fact that they possess unholy strength, vitality, and power; they don't even leave behind a useful carcass if slain in the Material Plane! Instead, they dissolve into a useless ichor while their spirit scurries back to the Abyss. Imagine the gall of these beings: to lose an honest fight, and then not give up your spoils to the victor! The impropriety!
P.S. Of course, other than that I should mention that using anything harvested from a demon comes with a certain risk of spiritual erosion, eternal damnation, demonic corruption, et cetera."-Hamund

Due to their abyssal nature, demons slain on the Material Plane cannot be harvested, as their carcass dissolves into a foul ichor instead. This ichor serves no purpose and is effectively useless. In order to properly harvest a demon, they must be killed in the Abyss.

Furthermore, using parts harvested from a demon comes with certain risks, as their corrupting influence remains even after their death. When a player consumes or attunes to an item made from a demon part, roll a d20. On a 10 or less, that player contracts a curse from using that item. The curse persists even after the normal effects of that item have finished and is only removed when the player is targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. If a character is cured of a curse caused by an attunement item, they are not allowed to attempt to attune to that item again. The DM may pick the curse themselves, or roll for it on the table below.

If the curse came from a non-consumable item, there is an additional aspect of the curse that reads: "You have a constant need to be within reach of the cursed item and are unwilling to part from it. You feel a need to have it equipped whenever feasibly possible."

## Fiendish Curse

## d6 Curse

1 You feel a rage constantly bubbling under your emotions, threatening to burst at any moment. Whenever a hostile creature damages you, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after your fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.
2 An unholy aura surrounds your spirit at all times. While this aura is invisible to any being that cannot see magic directly, creatures nevertheless feel its effects subconsciously and shun those who bear it. While cursed like this, you have disadvantage on any Animal Handling check and any Persuasion check made to try to persuade a non-evil creature.
3 The demonic tinge in your body makes you no different to a normal demon in the eyes of those who hunt them. You are considered to have an evil alignment regardless of your actual alignment, and your type is considered to be fiend, along with your regular type. You have disadvantage on any Charisma (Persuasion) check made to convince a goodaligned creature, and you also gain a vulnerability to radiant damage.
4 Constant whispers fill your mind, confusing your thoughts and weakening your resolve. You have disadvantage on all Wisdom saving throws.
5 Your fiendish corruption weakens your resolve when fighting against other demons. You have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special attacks.
6 An unnatural hunger pervades your thoughts and enfeebles your movements. Any time you go more than 3 consecutive hours without eating at least 1 pound of food, make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. The DC increases by 5 for every additional 3 hours you spend without consuming a pound of food. Both the DC and your exhaustion level is reset upon consuming at least 1 pound of food.

## BALOR

DC Item Description
Value Weight Crafting
15 Balor Ash The ashes of a balor after it has self destructed. Smelling strongly of brimstone, (3 small (3 small (3 small
$\mathrm{gp} \quad$ Bomb pouches) when creating particularly explosive bombs.

---

10 Barlgura The large fang of a barlgura is a little too unwieldy to use as an actual weapon. Fang They do however make fantastic ceremonial daggers and are often used in dark (x2) magic rituals.

15 Barlgura The enormous hands of a barlgura are capable of breaking a man in two with a Hand single blow. The tough knucklebones make wonderful weapon components. (x2)

20 Barlgura The rage of a barlgura is legendary even among the seething masses of Bile (2 demonkind. Such is their rage that their bile literally rises with their anger which vials) in turn becomes a fantastic potion base for those seeking to emulate the ferocity of this demon.

## Chasme

DC Item Description
10 Chasme A chasme's leg is capable of supporting its massive weight when walking on any Leg (x2) surface, even upside down. Intrepid adventurers have been known to repurpose these legs as pitons which stick to surfaces rather than stab into them. Use: You gain advantage on any Strength (Athletics) check made to climb walls so long as you use these legs when doing so.
15 Chasme The proboscis of a chasme has a dark ubiquity among those that hunt demon Proboscis cults. Too often have they been found on tables of twisted instruments of torture, used to extract blood from kidnapped victims before their inevitable sacrifice. It is truly a horrid feeling to have one's life sucked away by a chasme proboscis, and I would not wish it on my worst enemy.
20 Chasme The diaphonous wings of a chasme are perhaps their most dangerous appendage. Wing (x2) When vibrated at high speeds they create an unbearable buzzing not unlike a monstrous cloud of flies. Ambitious tinkers have studied the physiology of a chasme and figured out how to emulate their musculature in a machine capable of making the same droning noise.

## DRETCH

DC Item Description
15 Fetid If a dretch is useful for one thing it is to make a literal big stink. When masses of Miasma these demons gather, the resulting effluent can be more dangerous than even a (vial) rampaging balor.

Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a point within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Any creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions.

## Glabrezu

DC Item Description
10 Glabrezu The goat-like horn of a glabrezu. Does not contain much magical power in and of Horn itself, but some demonologists do enjoy grinding it up for their rituals, or speak (x2) through it to lend credence to their voice.

15 Glabrezu Resembling the claws of a giant crab, the glabrezu's pincers have a grip that can Pincer restrain even the strongest of creatures. Due to the glabrezu's natural fire resistance, resourceful blacksmiths repurpose these pincers as forging tools when working with magical flames.
20 Glabrezu The skin of a glabrezu is particularly tough and resistant to damage. If removed and Skin treated properly, the resulting leather makes for a similarly tough set of leather armour (with a fierce aesthetic as a bonus).

# Goristro 

DC Item Description
10 Goristro The fur of a goristro resembles that of a wild bull and seems to constantly Fur emanate a faint heat. More ostentatious warlocks tend to spin their winter (large cloaks from this material, but whether or not it has any magical utility is still up pouch) for debate.
15 Goristro The blood of the goristro constantly bubbles, even long after it is removed from Blood its source. When prepared into a potion, it can grant the drinker the strength of ( 7 vials) the demon it came from, but the side effects may not be worth it.
20 Goristro A goristro's hoof is made of the same material as its infamous horns and thus Hoof are just as hard. Wielding a hammer forged from these hooves is a surefire way (x2) to strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.
25 Goristro Castle architects and siege masters have an old joke, that if armies ever learned Horn how to train goristros, they'd both be out of a job. Indeed, the horn of the (x2) goristro is stronger than castle stone walls and a single one of these demons are capable of ending a siege by themselves. It takes a master craftsman to properly grind these horns down, but the resulting dust can be used to reinforce a weapon to make it as strong as the demon it was harvested from.

## Hezrou

DC Item Description
5 Hezrou The spiny, shark-like teeth of the hezrou. Menacing when attached to an Teeth implement of torture, but their irregular formation makes them useful for little (small bundle)
10 Hezrou The blood of the hezrou is as thick and sludgy as week old garbage, and smells Blood (5 just as bad. If you have the stomach for it however, injesting it with a few vials) neutralising herbs temporarily innoculates the body to foul miasmas and effluents.
15 Hezrou The rank stench of the hezrou lingers in one's memory long after they have already Stink been removed from its presence. Removing this gland without rupturing it takes Gland an extrordinarily steady hand, but once harvested, can be thrown as a quick and dirty bomb.
Use: As an action you may throw this item at a point within 20 feet, causing it to explode on impact. Any creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.
20 Hezrou The enormous claw of the hezrou. Incredibly sharp, and never seems to dull. Can Claw be forged into a powerful and intimidating weapon.

## Manes

DC Item Description
5 Manes The vapour from a defeated manes is a noxious substance that cloys in the throat and Vapour leaves the eyes watering. Thankfully, exposure to it is not overly dangerous, and can (vial) in fact be used to temporarily boost one's immune system in exchange for relatively mild symptoms.

## Marilith

DC Item Description
10 Marilith Mariliths are renowned for the supernatural reflexes and inhuman co-ordination that Blood allows them to fight with six arms seamlessly. By placing their blood in a crucible, an (5 experienced alchemist can extract the adrenaline from a maralith's blood and mix it vials) into a potion that allows a mortal to temporarily emulate the agility of this fearsome demon.
15 Marilith While it resembles an ordinary snake, the skin of the marilith's reptilian tail is harder Snake and tougher than most plate armour. It is a rare craftsman that possesses the skills Leather to properly work this leather, but finding one is worth it for the almost impenetrable armour you will receive.

20 Marilith While their top halves may superficially resemble a humans with a few additional Spine limbs, the internal physiology of a marilith differs dramatically. Most noticeably in their spines which have been adapted to support the numerous extra limbs and lower appendage of this demon. This spine may serve as the frame of an audacious magical cape that grants an extra "helping hand" in battle.

5 Nalfeshnee While they may be yellow and stained from centuries of poor hygiene, the teeth Teeth of a nalfeshnee are still made of a high quality ivory that surpasses those found in (small (small pouch) mortals. They may be made into a variety of things, but the nalfeshnee's glutton nature lends them well to being made into cutlery.
10 Nalfeshnee Heavy and thick, much like the nalfeshnee itself. Make a weapon from these tusks Tusk (x2) and you can gore your enemies with all the strength of the Abyss.

15 Nalfeshnee The almost comically small wings of a nalfeshnee do not function on actual Wing (x2) physics to support its large weight, but rather sophisticated space displacement magic that belies the nalfeshnee's brutish appearance. These wings are also responsible for the nalfeshnee's ability to teleport, something that can be taken advantage of by a skilled harvester.
Use: You may spend an action focusing on a wing in your hand. If you do so, you magically teleport, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once this item has been used once, it loses all magical properties and becomes useless.
20 Nalfeshnee Nalfeshnees are full of surprises that hide behind their otherwise savage looking Eyes (x2) appearance. The most dangerous of these are their eyes which are capable of producing a horrifyingly captivating light that destroys the wills of any unlucky enough to see it. With good artificing, these eyes can be transformed into gems to give off a similar performance.

## Quasit

DC Item Description
5 Quasit Quasit venom is more of an annoyance than a serious threat, but the paralysis side Venom effect can certainly ruin someone's day. When mixed with other ingredients however, (vial) this venom can serve as one of many potential bases for a potion of poison.

10 Quasit Quasit blood is as thin and slippery as the demon it came from, but serves as an Blood excellent spell component for lower-tier magic.
(vial) Use: The next time you cast the find familiar spell, you may consume a vial of quasit blood instead of using the usual material component of the spell. If you do, your summoned familiar gains the magic resistance trait described in the quasit's statblock. Your familiar also shares this trait with you so long as you are within 10 feet of it. Both of these effects last for 1 hour, or until your familiar next disappears or is dismissed.

## Shadow Demon

DC Item Description
20 Demonic As the shadow demon lacks a substantial form, there is nothing to harvest from it Imprint except its spiritual essence. However, if one manages to capture this essence using spirit paper, they will essentially hold complete dominion over said demon. At this point, the spirit paper has a myriad of uses, but the most popular among demonologists is to transfer the essence to a demon amulet. This gives the owner the ability to resummon the demon in their proper physical form, while still maintaining complete control over them. Requires spirit paper.

VROCK
DC Item Description
5 Vrock Black as the night and twice as scary. While they make for a macabre flourish to Feathers one's outfit at a costume party, they aren't useful for much else. (small bundle)

10 Vrock The talons of a vrock are incredibly sharp, easily capable of rending through armour Talon like a scythe through dry grass. When fashioned into a set of daggers, they can make (x2) one a cut above the rest in a fight.

15 Vrock The terrifying screech of a vrock is capable of stunning creatures with its piercing Vocal volume. While a removed vrock's vocal cords are unable to create the same effect, a good tinker can use them for a slightly different diabolical purpose.

20 Vrock The collected spores of a vrock, requiring a special collection process and Spores preservation in oil to ensure they retain their potency even after the original owner's death.
Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the spores takes 1 minute. For the next 10 minutes, the coated item is considered magical and any creature successfully hit by this weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 1 d 10 poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.

## YOCHLOL

DC Item Description
15 Demon Yochlol's do not so much eat as they do engulf their prey. While the yochlol's Pearl digestive enzymes are capable of dissolving just about anything given enough time, there are occasionally a few items that gather inside the yochlol that do not break down and instead stay inside its slime body. Like an oyster, the yochlol forms layers around these undigestible materials, creating pearl-like substances. Unfortunately these pearls share the same sickly yellow colour as the yochlol, making them more novelties than anything else.
20 Yochlol The ooze of a yochlol is said to be more poisonous than that of the deadliest spiders Ooze in the world. It is ironic then that the other societies of the Underdark use this poison (vial) against the drow after they have defeated their demonic servants.
Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 6 d 6 poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw.

# DEVILS 

"Devils are just as bad as demons in terms of harvesting. To have the nerve of making me go all the way to the Nine Hells just to harvest some devil blood is the height of rudeness. As a small upside, their ichor does make for a wonderful substance with which to tar one's roof." - Hamund

Due to their fiendish nature, devils slain on the Material Plane cannot be harvested, as their carcasses dissolve into a foul ichor or disappear into smoke instead. These serve no purpose and are effectively useless. In order to properly harvest a demon, they must be killed in the Nine Hells.

Furthermore, using parts harvested from a devil comes with certain risks, as their corrupting influence remains even after their death. When a player consumes or attunes to an item made from a devil part, roll a d20. On a 10 or less, that player contracts a curse from using that item. The curse persists even after the normal effects of that item have finished and is only removed when the player is targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. If a character is cured of a curse caused by an attunement item, they are not allowed to attempt to attune to that item again. The DM may pick the curse themselves, or roll for it on the table below:

If the curse came from a non-consumable item, there is an additional aspect of the curse that reads: "you have a constant need to be within reach of the cursed item and are unwilling to part from it. You feel a need to have it equipped whenever feasibly possible."

## Fiendish Curse d6 Curse

1 You feel a rage constantly bubbling under your emotions, threatening to burst at any moment. Whenever a hostile creature damages you, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after your fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.
2 An unholy aura surrounds your spirit at all times. While this aura is invisible to any being that cannot see magic directly, creatures nevertheless feel its effects subconsciously and shun those who bear it. While cursed like this, you have disadvantage on any Animal Handling check and any Persuasion check made to try to persuade a non-evil creature.
3 The devilish tinge in your body makes you no different to a normal devil in the eyes of those who hunt them. You are considered to have an evil alignment regardless of your actual alignment, and your type is considered to be fiend, along with your regular type. You have disadvantage on any Charisma (Persuasion) check made to convince a goodaligned creature, and you also gain a vulnerability to radiant damage.
4 Constant whispers fill your mind, confusing your thoughts and weakening your resolve. You have disadvantage on all Wisdom saving throws.
5 Your fiendish corruption weakens your resolve when fighting against other devils. You have disadvantage on attack rolls against devils and on saving throws against their spells and special attacks.
6 An unnatural hunger pervades your thoughts and enfeebles your movements. Any time you go more than 3 consecutive hours without eating at least 1 pound of food, make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. The DC increases by 5 for every additional 3 hours you spend without consuming a pound of food. Both the DC and your exhaustion level is reset upon consuming at least 1 pound of food.

10 Barbed Touching a barbed devil is like sleeping in a bed of porcupines. Incredibly sharp and Devil durable, these barbs sometimes find a second use as nails in the crafting of Barb particular sets of armour and equipment. Otherwise they serve as building material (x10) for sturdy arrows and bolts.
15 Barbed Barbed devils fight with a frenzy unmatched by many mortal creatures. As such, by Hide the time you finish hunting them, their carcass is so damaged that their hide becomes effectively useless. If you manage to skin one properly however, the hide can be treated, tanned, and turned into a cloak that is perfect for deterring anyone who thinks that hugging is an acceptable form of greeting.
20 Barbed Despite their name, barbed devils harbour just as much proclivity for employing fire Devil magic as they do their barbs. The fire is literally in their blood, and with proper Blood alchemy, it can be in yours too.
(3
vials)
25 Barbed The barbed devil's tail is even deadlier than its razor sharp claws, and when swung Devil at full force is said to crumple plate armour and pierce the flesh beneath. Tail Thankfully, there is nothing stopping anyone else from taking this tail, crafting it into a whip, and using it for their own purposes.

## BEARDED DEVIL

DC Item Description
10 Bearded A bearded devil fights with a ferocity unmatched by any mortal. Even in the rare Devil occurances in which a bearded devil unit finds itself outnumbered, they continue to Blood fight, never once breaking rank. If one takes their blood, distills it and mixes it into a (3 vials) draught, they too can share in the infamous bravery of these fiendish warriors.
15 Clump A disgrace to beards and bearded creatures around the multiverse. The lashes that of extrude from the bearded devil's chin are tougher than oiled cords and covered with Beard dozens of wicked barbs. Any weaponsmith worth their forge can craft these lashes Lashes into a particularly powerful flail.
20 Beard Difficult to extricate from the diminuitive glands hidden in the bearded devil's chin, Poison this poison maintains its potency and is often used by assassins targetting magically (vial) talented individuals.
Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target can't regain hit points. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## BONE DEVIL

DC Item Description
10 Bone The bones of the bone devil are considerably durable and feel more like steel than Devil bone. They can be refashioned into a suite of fire-resistant tools, but due to their Bone origin, not many are willing to use them.
(large
bag)
15 Bone Despite their appearance, a bone devil actually does possess skin; a dessicated sheet Devil that is stretched tight over its bones. While those properties are undesirable in a skin, Skin they make for a perfect sheet of vellum. Indeed, the infamous skin-bound abyssal tomes found in dark libraries are often made using bone devil skin.
20 Bone The stinger of the bone devil's tail is sharp enough to pierce through even the Devil toughest of armour and deliver a potent dose of debilitating venom. With a few Tail modifications, this tail can be adapted into a whip to store and deliver any kind of poison the wielder wishes.
20 Devil The diaphonous but extraordinarily strong wings of the bone devil. Despite their Wings (x2) relatively fragile appearance, they are strong enough to hold the considerably heavy bone devil aloft and allow it to fly at high speeds.

15 Living The chains of this devil's namesake occupy a unique space between animate and Chain inanimate. They are bewitched by similar magic to the notorious animated objects that are often found in an abandoned wizard's tower, and thus make excellent material for the crafting of magical items.

20 Chain The gaze of the chain devil is renowned for its unnerving countenance. Those Devil who stare at it for too long swear that they see the faces of those they'd rather Eye forget. With some enchantments and a bit of craftsmanship, the eyes can be (x2) inserted into a mask that can strike the same fear into the wearer's enemies.

## Erinyes

DC Item Description
10 Fiendish Although the erinyes is a master warrior whose swordplay is matched by few mortals, Poison they are not above poisoning their weapons to further tip the scales in their favour. (vial) Use: Can coat up to 10 pieces of ammunition or 1 melee weapon for 1 hour. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. Any creature successfully hit must succeed a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer 3d8 poison damage and be poisoned. The poison lasts until it is removed by the lesser restoration spell or similar magic.
15 Erinyes It is said that the first erinyeses were fallen angels, corrupted by exposure to the Heart fiendish energies of the Abyss. Whether or not that is true, the heart of an erinyes certainly possesses some degree of corrupting influence itself and can be used as a magical reagent when crafting a cursed weapon.
Use: Upon successful creation of a weapon or piece of armour that requires attunement to use, the crafter may use the erinyes heart to perform a ritual that curses the newly made piece of equipment. If they do so, the crafted equipmet carries a random curse from the "fiendish curses" table. Performing this ritual destroys the erinyes heart.
20 Devil The great wings of the erinyes that resemble those of a fiery eagle in flight. Wings Inherently magical and easily repurposed into a pair of infernal wings.

## Horned Devil

DC Item Description
10 Horned The eponymous horns of the horned devil resemble those of an oversized goat. Devil Extremely hard, they make striking trophies when mounted on one's mantle or Horn (x2) displayed in a sacrilegious ritual; whichever is more appealing to you.

15 Horned Horned devils are noticebly lazy and sluggish, especially for a creature as Devil motivated as a devil. When their blood is mixed with other soporifics, it creates a Blood ( 5 tonic that can weaken the motivation of even the most stalwart creature. vials)
20 Horned The tail of the horned devil ends in a vicious barb designed to open wounds and Devil Tail cause a victim to die a slow, painful death. If removed from the horned devil however, the tail can be repurposed into a vicious pike, spear, or whip.
20 Devil As the horned devil serves as the flying soldier for the armies of the Abyss, their Wings (x2) wings are particularly strong and make good crafting material.

## Ice Devil

DC Item Description
15 Ice Devil Ice devils bleed a blue substance that resembles dirty slush. If one melts this Blood ( 5 blood down and then rethickens it with certain powders, the resulting potion is vials) capable of making the drinker impervious to even the most fierce winter.
20 Ice Devil It is said that being pierced by the mandibles of an ice devil feels like being Mandible impaled upon an icicle. As such, it seemed obvious that weaponsmiths would (x2) scramble to attach them to sticks and hilts to make weapons that harness the power of pure winter.
25 Ice Devil The chitinous shell of the ice devil is colder and harder than an ancient buried Carapace ice sheet, and requires patience and a sharp ice pick to harvest in tact. Using a specialised forge, a very skilled blacksmith can reshape this carapace into a suit of armour that can protect the wearer from any form of extreme temperature.

5 Imp The stinger of an imp can be surprisingly dangerous if one receives a full dose of the Venom venom within.
(vial) Use: Can coat up to 5 pieces of ammunition or 1 melee weapon for 10 minutes. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. Any creature successfully hit must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
10 Imp Imp blood is as thin and slippery as the devil it came from, but serves as an excellent Blood spell component for lower-tier magic.
(vial) Use: The next time you cast the find familiar spell, you may consume a vial of imp blood instead of the usual material component of the spell. If you do, your summoned familiar gains the magic resistance trait described in the imp familiar's statblock. Your familiar also shares this trait with you so long as you are within 10 feet of it. Both of these effects last for 1 hour, or until your familiar next disappears or is dismissed.
15 Imp Imp's are well known for their constant drone, incessantly gibbering promises of Head power and corruption to their so called "masters." In death however, their tendency to spy and spill secrets can be put to better use. An imp's severed head, along with some choice necromantic rituals and artificing can create a magical censer that alerts its owner to the presence of fiends in the vicinity.

## Lemure

DC Item Description
10 Lemure The blobbish, fetid body of the lemure is useful for little in both life and in death. Essence Their essence on the other hand is much more useful, as it serves as the currency of the Nine Hells (due to price fluctuations, the value of an individual lemure soul may differ depending on the time of reading). As the lemure technically belongs to the devil who corrupted its original soul in the first place, do beware when harvesting these as there may be a devil who is less than pleased about being robbed.

## Pit Fiend

DC Item Description
10 Pit A pit fiend's blood hisses, boils, and bubbles long after it has been removed Fiend from its body, as if the fiend's wrath at its enemies continues even after its Blood death. Cooling this blood and seperating out the plasma can create a potion that (5 grants the drinker the same unholy vitality of its original owner.
vials)
10 Pit A pit fiend's venom is one of the most insidious of all the fiends. Besides the Fiend horrible pain they inflict on their victim, its corrupting influence even blocks out Venom magical assistance, keeping wounds open and bleeding even in the face of (3 divine help.

## Dopplerganger

"I once heard an amusing anecdote about a doppelganger that attended a party with the intention of seducing the love interest of the man whose identity they had stolen. Little did they know that the love interest was also a doppelganger that had been come to seduce him. Long story short, they're married now (still in their stolen identities) and run a successful inn by the coast."-Hamund

DC Item Description
10 Doppelganger The blood of the doppelganger is unnervingly slick and in its natural state Blood (3 carries the same rainbow sheen as a puddle of oil. When it is being held, it vials) changes colour to match the blood of the creature holding it.
Use: When you drink a vial of this blood that has had a drop of a humanoid's blood mixed into it, you polymorph into a form identical to that humanoid for the next 1 d 4 hours. Your statistics, other than your size remain the same in that form. Any equipment you are carrying or wearing is not transformed. You revert to your true form at the end of the duration or if you die.
15 Doppelganger Although the thought may be unpleasant, the skinned face of the Face doppelganger can provide several uses when used as a mask. Even in death, the doppelganger's face maintains a "muscle memory" of the last few identities that it impersonated. With some concentration, someone wearing the face can force it to dredge up this memory and change the wearer's appearance to that identity.
Use: While wearing the doppelganger face, a creature may spend 1 minute visualising a humanoid that the doppelganger has shapeshifted into within the past 24 hours. At the end of that minute, the face mask fuses with the wearer, causing their head to shapeshift into a perfect replica of the visualised humanoid along with their voice. Nothing else about the wearer's body changes however. After 24 hours, the mask seperates from the wearer, transforming them back into their regular form. The mask then deteriorates into a useless sheet of skin.
20 Doppelganger A doppelganger's deception is aided by their low level of telepathic ability. Brain Careful dissection of their brain can yield dark lobes that may be used by an artificer to create a helmet with similar telepathic abilities.

# Dracoligh 

"When a dracolich's spirit enters the corpse of another dragon, it begins a blasphemous process that transforms the corpse into something more suited to the dracolich's dark preferences. Not only is this an affront to all that is natural, it wastes a perfectly good dragon carcass. More than once have I downed a mighty dragon, only to find my assistants were draconic cultists who immediately stole my prize out from under me by lobbing a spirit gem at it. You can only imagine the umbrage I felt not only at now having to fend off an undead dragon, but also losing my chance of having dragon steaks for supper."Hamund

## DC Item Description

10 Dracolich Bone simply slough off flesh and skin, it also changes the entire nature of the dragon and suffuses it with an unholy energy that marks it even after the dracolich's spirit is driven off once again. If these bones are taken, ground to a dust and then infused in a magical censer, the user can divine the location of the dracolich's spirit gem and put an end to it once and for all.

## Dragon, Shadow

DC Item Description
15 Shadowflame Ember (3 vials)

20 Shadow Dragon Scale (large bag) (only harvestable from dragon's that have progressed beyond the wyrmling stage)
25 Shadowdragon Wing ( $\times 2$ ) (only harvestable from adult and ancient dragons)

## Description

After death, a shadow dragon's "flame" quickly snuffs itself out, dissolving into the shadows around it. If one is quick however, they can capture an ember in an enchanted vial to be used for later. Requires enchanted vial
The scales of the shadow dragon are a curious colour that can only be described as the colour of a shadow at dusk. Despite their ethereal appearance however, they maintain their incredible durability and strength. If forged into a suit of armour, it can make even the bulkiest of knights disappear when in darkness.
The ever shifting wings of the shadow dragon make it appear more like a dark cloud when it swoops upon its prey. They are more fragile than regular dragon wings and require great care when harvested, however these same special properties make them invaluable when crafting implements of flight and stealth.

# Dragons 

"Of all the trophies that a hunter can bag, a true dragon tops the list. Physical embodiments of fire, lightning, cold, poison, and acid; all wrapped up in iron-hard scales and gale-force wings. One would be a fool to hunt these creatures alone; to hunt them with friends only marginally less so. But the rewards are great. Almost every part of these magical creatures are useful in some way, whether it be for crafting, spellwork, or just a culinary delight. Still, it is important to note that the older and larger a dragon is, the more valuable the game. The parts of a properly harvested young dragon alone can sell for thousands of gold pieces, but the proceeds from an ancient dragon would put you, your children, and your children's children in comfort for life." Hamund

Dragons are identified in 4 stages of life: Wyrmling, Young, Adult, and Ancient. The harvesting tables below outline the different types, quantities, and qualities of parts that can be harvested from dragons at different stages of their lives. When noting down the parts harvested, it is important to note which age bracket of the dragon being harvested, as the value of the part and its utility in crafting varies wildly between age groups.

The harvesting table does not differentiate between the different colours/metals of the dragon it was harvested from. Instead, [Type] is used as a stand-in. When noting down the harvested part, replace [Type] with the colour/metal of the dragon it was harvested from. This is important, as different dragons are aligned with different damage types and resistances, which will ultimately change the nature of items crafted from that part.

Some crafted items will have differing levels of power depending on what age group the dragon it was crafted from belonged in. For example, dragon bone can be crafted into any weapon, but that weapon will have a different bonus depending on the dragon's age: +1 for young, +2 for adult, and +3 for ancient. The crafted item will specify in its description when such a distinction makes a difference.

Crafted items may also change their nature depending on the colour/metal of the dragon it was crafted from. If a crafted items description refers to the "harvested dragon's damage type," refer to the following table to determine that damage type.

| Dragon | Damage Type | Dragon | Damage Type |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Black | Acid | Brass | Fire |
| Blue | Lightning | Bronze | Lightning |
| Green | Poison | Copper | Acid |
| Red | Fire | Gold | Fire |
| White | Cold | Silver | Cold |

|  10 | Dragon <br> Flesh | Despite common misconception, dragon flesh does not contain any magical benefit. It does however contain many culinary benefits. The exact flavour differs depending on the type of dragon it was taken from, but anybody that has eaten a dragon steak claims that it puts even the most exquisite aged beef to shame. There are many royal cooks and larders that would pay a high sum for just a pound of this delicacy. | 150 gp | 30 lb . |  |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  10 | [Type] Dragon Blood (9 vials) | The blood of an ancient dragon is one of the most powerful spell reagents and potion ingredients in existence. Even besides its use in the birth of half-dragon soldiers and other rituals, the most common use of potent dragon blood is to make a potion that can imbue the drinker with the same strengths as the dragon it was taken from. | 300 gp | 1 lb . | Potion of Dragonstrength |   |
|  15 | [Type] Dragon Tooth (x15) | The teeth of a full grown ancient dragon have been the end of many a hapless adventurer. Longer than a full grown human's arm, constant exposure to the dragon's breath attack has infused them with a modicum of elemental power. A master fletcher can craft a special set of arrows from these teeth, still carrying their original elemental charge. | 60 gp | 14 lb . | [Type] Dragon Arrow or [Type] Dragon Bolt |   |
|  15 | [Type] Dragon Bone (x6) | The bones of a dragon are as hard and durable as the rest of their body. Not many weaponsmiths know how to reshape dragon bone, and those that do, keep it a guarded secret (most likely to avoid the ire of paranoid dragons). However, there is a good reason that myths and legends of heroes carrying dragonbone weapons abound in every culture: anyone who has seen one will agree that they simply have no equal. | 900 gp | 20 lb . | Dragon Bone Weapon |   |
|  15 | [Type] Dragon Horn/Spine | Depending on the type of dragon, a horn or a prominent spine may adorn their head. In either case, the bony protrusion may be sawed off and used as a basis for exceptionally powerful wands and staves. | 1,600 gp | 30 lb | [Type] Dragon Wand |   |
|  20 | [Type] Dragon Scales (large bag) | The notoriously hard scales of an ancient dragon. Harder than steel yet surprisingly light, it is the dream of every armoursmith to craft a suit from this legendary material. Getting them is easier said than done however, as not only must one kill an ancient dragon first, they must also manage to find and safely detach the right scales needed to interlock into a functioning set of armour. | 4,000 gp | 45 lb | [Type] Dragon Scale Mail (DMG) |   |
|  20 | [Type] Dragon Breath Pouch | When the word "dragon" is uttered, people tend to think of three things: wings, scales, and breath. Located at the back of the dragon's throat is a basket sized sack of magical liquids that the dragon naturally produces. While the liquid and their resulting exhalation differ depending on the dragon, they all share the same destructive results. Harvesting one of these without rupturing them is almost as difficult as killing its host in the first place, but the result is a concentrated pouch of destruction. Use: May be thrown up to 15 feet, upon which the pouch explodes. Any target within 15 feet of the explosion must roll a saving throw or suffer the effects of the primary breath weapon that the pouch was harvested from. The saving throw type and DC, the damage type, and the damage amount are identical to the breath weapon of the dragon it was harvested from. | 4,000 gp | 15 lb . | [Type] Dragon's Wrath |   |
|  20 | [Type] Secondary Dragon Breath Pouch (Metallic Dragons only) | The metallic dragons are considered to be less violent than their chromatic cousins and this is reflected in their alternate breath weapons. While their primary breath weapons mimic those of the chromatics, all metallics dragons wield a secondary, much less harmful breath weapon. This too can be harvested and used for similar purposes as the primary dragon breath pouch. Use: May be thrown up to 15 feet, upon which the pouch explodes. Any target within 15 feet of the explosion must roll a saving throw or suffer the effects of the secondary breath weapon that the pouch was harvested from. The saving throw type, DC, and the effect are identical to the secondary breath weapon of the dragon it was harvested from. | 4,000 gp | 15 lb . | [Type] Dragon's Mercy |   |
|  25 | Dragon Wing (x2) | The wings of a dragon defy any sense of natural law. Even considering their own immense size, they could not possibly lift a form as massive as the ancient dragon they bear, and yet they do. Only a magical force, inherent in their leathery membranes, could make such flight possible. Cloaks fashioned from these membranes can provide similar propulsion to other creatures, along with providing a stylistic fashion choice. | 8,000 gp | 120 lb . | Cloak of Dragonflight |   |
|  30 | Dragon Heart | Whether they were good or evil, a dragon is a akin to a force of nature and possessing the heart of an ancient dragon is no small matter (even ignoring the fact that it is the size of a large dwarf). Through ancient rituals and careful forging, the heart can be transformed into a crystal that imparts the traits of a dragon onto its wielder; for better or for worse. | 26,000 gp | 65 lb . | Dragon Stone |   |

# Drider 

"You would think that a drider's top half is identical internally to its original drow body, but you would be wrong. In fact, a drider's old drow torso is incredibly mutated to match its new physiology, and no two seem to be alike. Indeed, some driders have been noted to either keep some of their original organs and grow duplicates in their spider halves, or just find their original ones liquefy completely, leaving their torsos as nothing but glorified head-supports." - Hamund

## DC Item Description

10 Drider Anybody who has observed a spider will notice that they do not stick to their own Oil (4 webs, and a drider is no exception. For the drider, this comes in the form of a gland vials) that secretes an oily substance that covers the almost invisible hairs on their legs. This oil prevents them from sticking to any sort of webbing and also contributes to the black sheen on their bodies.
Use: 1 vial contains enough oil to cover one medium or smaller sized creature. A creature covered by this oil gains the drider's web walker feature for the next hour.

15 Drider Drider poison is just as deadly as those of the cave spiders it emulates. By removing Poison the gland from under the drider's tongue however, this poison can be extracted and (vial) put to better use.
Use: Can coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or 1 slashing or piercing weapon for 10 minutes. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. Any creature successfully hit receives an additional $2 d 8$ poison damage.

20 Mark Unbenownst to many is that each drider is marked by more than just the physical of transformation of their lower body into that of a giant spider. Each drider also receives Lolth a permanent mark in the shape of the symbol of Lolth. The issue is that the location of this mark changes with each individual drider, so a thorough investigation of the carcass is required to find it. Once that is done however, the mark provides uses in channelling certain powers from the drow goddess, even against her own will.

# Dryad 

DC Item Description
5 Dryad Hair is used as a loose term, as the material covering a dryad's head more resembles Hair loose foliage and vines than actual hair. Still, it is beautiful to behold and surprisingly strong. More ostentatious adventurers use the hair as rope to commemorate their conquest of a dryad...in either sense of the term.
10 Dryad Instead of blood, dryads have a sap-like substance flowing through their bodies. This Sap sap contains magical properties and can enhance the durability of a creature that is (vial) rubbed on. Use: Can be used to coat one medium or smaller creature. Applying the sap takes 1 minute, after which the sap takes effect. While under the effect of the sap, that creature is under an effect identical to that of the barkskin spell. This effect does not require any concentration check to maintain however. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
15 Dryad Many who have wandered through the forest at night can attest to seeing two orbs of Eye silver or gold, dancing through the tree branches, and beckoning them to join them. (x2) These are usually the eyes of a dryad, and there are not many living creatures that can gaze into them and not be enthralled. The eyes maintain these properties even after the dryad is killed and their eyes transfigured into useful equipment for adventurers.

"Usually I hold some hesitation in harvesting humanoids, finding the act more than a little barbaric. The sole exception comes to duergar. As a proud dwarf, it is my duty to not just kill a duergar when I find them, but to also take any loot their carcass may offer." - Hamund

DC Item Description
10 Duergar Due to their years of slavery to the illithid race, duergar have developed a range Brainstem of psionic powers. Some of these powers are inherent in any member of their race regardless of training. If one dissects the brain of a duergar, they will find that their brainstem is particularly large and often pulsates even after death. This brainstem may be used as an ingredient in various potions that temporarily grant the drinker the same powers as an average duergar.

# Elves - Drow 

"I have personally faced off against so many drow in my travels that it's a wonder I don't spontaneously transform into a duergar. While their blood is of some use to alchemists, most of their value does come from the items they carry on themselves. Many an elf on the surface would pay a good sum for a drow trinket or two, if only to claim that they themselves were the ones to slay its previous owner."-Hamund

# EMPYREAN 

"Personally, I would avoid harvesting an empyrean if for whatever reason you come across its corpse. You don't want their parents to find you walking around with their child's heart as a trinket."- Hamund

Carrying the remains of an empyrean make you particularly susceptible to the scrying attempts of the divine parent of that empyrean. While holding any material taken or crafted from an empyrean, you automatically fail the saving throw associated with the casting of the scry spell, or similar ability, by the parent of that empyrean.

## DC Item Description

10 Lock of The hair of an empyrean is akin to silk in both its lustre and texture, another sign Empyrean of their celestial heritage. As such, it makes wonderful material for making hardy

Hair ties and ropes. If you want to use it for less mundane purposes however, it makes ( $\times 10$ ) for a good material component in the augury spell; the hairs changing colour depending on your fate. It would be advised however not to attempt this if your benefactor was also this empyrean's parent.
15 Empyrean If the empyrean's skin and size didn't already give away their divine provenance, Blood ( 7 their blood surely will. Gold and sparkling for good aligned empyreans, black and vials) viscous for evil aligned empyreans, this blood contains many magical properties, especially in alchemy. Drinkers of any potion brewed from empyrean blood should beware though, as doing so is a blasphemous act that marks the drinker permanently in the eyes of the empyrean's parent.
20 Marble The skin of an empyrean resembles that of living marble and shares much of its Skin durability. It takes a very steady hand and great skill to remove it without shattering it into a thousand pieces, but the result is a hide that flexes like leather but protects like stone.

25 Empyrean The heart of an empyrean seems to carry an otherworldly energy when held, and Heart people who gaze upon one often mention feeling boosts in confidence and mood.
Use: As an action you may squeeze the heart, activating a pulse of emotional energy and inspiration that bolsters all nonhostile creatures within 120 feet. Bolstered creatures can't be charmed or frightened, and they gain advantage on ability checks and saving throws until the end of the wielder's next turn. This ability may be used 3 times, after which, the heart withers away.

## ETTERCAP

DC Item Description
10 Ettercap Ettercaps secrete a noxious venom from their fangs that weakens any creature Poison unfortunate enough to fall prey to it. By removing the poison gland, one can easily (vial) harvest some of this poison for their own use.
Use: Can be used to coat up to 3 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit by this wepaon must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
15 Web Like a real spider, the ettercap is capable of dispensing web from glands housed in Gland its abdomen. The gland is rather delicate once removed from its host, but the silk contained within is well regarded as a material for ropes and other items. Alternatively, it can just be lobbed at a foe to make a sticky explosion. Use: As an action, you may throw the web gland up to 15 feet. Upon impact with the ground, the web gland explodes, forcing all creatures within 5 feet to succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained creature can make a DC 11 Strength check, escaping from the webbing on a success. The effect ends if the webbing is destroyed. The webbing has AC 10, 5 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

## Ettin

DC Item Description
10 Ettin
Fingernail

## Description

Like other giants, the fingernail sliver of an ettin is a key ingredient in the

brewing of a potion of giant strength, in this case, acting as a stand in for a hill giant's. Despite the misconception among adventurers who believe that felling one giant can supply them potions for life, only one potion can be brewed per giant. This is because the alchemical process uses the fingernail as a channeling foci to summon that particular giant's strength and thus renders any other attempts moot.
15 Ettin Though ettins are often witnessed physically talking to their twinned head, Head their unique physiology causes their brains to share information subconsciously; a trait that can be exploited through clever artificing. Indeed, it is probably ironic that despite being among the dumbest beings on the Material Plane, ettins are capable of mental techniques that elude even the most prestigious of minds.

# Harvest Table: F 

## Faerie Dragon

DC Item Description
10 Faerie The blood of a faerie dragon is the same bright hue as its scales and also changes as Dragon the dragon ages. The blood's inherent magical properties makes it an excellent ink Blood when transcribing spells.
(vial) Use: If you attempt to transcribe a spell into your spellbook or spell scroll that was known to the faerie dragon you harvested this blood from, you may use this vial of blood instead of the regular ink. Doing so halves the regular time it would take to make that transcription, and the cost of the vial of blood is deducted from the total cost of the transcription.
15 Faerie Faerie dragons are not altogether harmful, although they boast a number of traits that Dragon make them a nuisance to encounter. One such feature is their euphoria breath: a gas Lungs that temporarily incapacitates a creature that breathes it in. Special bronchials in the faerie dragon's lungs are responsible for the production of this gas, and still contain traces of it, even after the faerie dragon's death.
Use: This ability may only be used if the faerie dragon had access to its euphoria breath ability at the time of its death. As an action, you may squeeze the faerie dragon's lungs at one creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target can't take reactions and must roll a d6 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behaviour during the turn. Refer to the euphoria breath ability in the faerie dragon's statblock for potential results.
20 Faerie The wings of a faerie dragon resemble that of a butterfly in more ways than one. Dragon Besides their diaphonous texture, they also possess a light coating of dust that Wing enhances their invisibility magic and aids them in their flight. If harvested undamaged, (x2) these wings may be crushed, powdered, and mixed with powdered catalyst gems to enchant objects with flight and invisibility.

## FlameSKULL

DC Item Description
10 Flameskull After a flameskull is destroyed, the magical flames that surrounded it leave Ashes behind an ashy residue around the skull. These ashes contain "memories" of the (small magic that the flameskull knew in life, and may be used as a special pigment for pouch) wizards trying to expand their spellbook.
Use: A character may add any spell available to the flameskull to their own spellbook as if they had found the spell in a spellscroll or similar. Doing so follows the same rules as the copying a spell into the book rules on page 114 of the Player's Handbook, using the flameskull ashes instead of ink. The character may deduct the cost of the flameskull ashes from the overall cost of copying the spell.
15 Flameskull A flameskull is a cursed creature, an echo of the brilliance it had in its mortal life. 60gp 6 lb . Skull of Even after the skull has been defeated and its essence cleansed, the physical skull still contains traces of the magic it once had. If you are willing to further disgrace the wizard that the skull came from, a few choice runes and inlays on the skull can bring out this magic to your own advantage.

# FLUMPH 

"I have conquered many creatures. In my pursuit of writing a comprehensive guide, I have had to fell many which some would find heartbreaking to kill. I have shot majestic gryphons from the sky, crushed precocious pixies, and even felled an angel or two. Still, I have never felt as awful as when I drove a knife through a harmless flumph that had wandered into my path. I hope that whichever god I meet in the ever-after could forgive me for such an act."-Hamund

# FUNGI 

## GAS SPORE

DC Item Description
10 Gas The lighter than air gas that allows a gas spore to fly remains potent even after it is Spore popped. It takes a quick hand and a deep breath to bottle some without accidentally Gas breathing deadly gas spores, however. Requires enchanted vial.
(vial)
15 Gas Collecting the deadly spores of a gas spore must be done within one round of the Spore creature's death, as spores that land in inorganic matter become useless. Collection of Colony these spores must be done in a vial that contains a few drops of a creature's blood to (vial) give the spore colony the nutrients it needs to survive. While the spores are dangerous to inhale, drinking them also carries a risk, unless the spores are dropped in alcohol, which kills the spores.
Use: As an action, the vial may be thrown up to 20 feet at a target creature, shattering on impact. Make a ranged attack against that creature. On a successful hit, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effects described in the death burst trait of the gas spore's statblock. This item must be used within 24 hours of the death of the initial gas spore's death, otherwise the colony will grow too large in the vial to properly invade another creature's system.

## SHRIEKER

DC Item Description
15 Shrieker It is difficult to remove the gills of a shrieker without damaging them, however it Spore yields a bounty of spores that can be used in the production of the drink "Shrieker Colony Scotch," the taste of which has been described as "loud." If you are not a fan of (vial) alcohol, it can simply be used for magical purposes.

Use: The shrieker spore colony may be expended as a material component when casting the alarm spell. When cast in this way, the caster does not use a spell slot.

# Harvest Table: G 

## Galeb-Duhr

DC Item Description
10 Enchanted The joints of a galeb-duhr are of a slightly different mineral compound Pumice resembling pumice. This is presumably to facilitate easier movement for the creatures. While it is extraordinarily brittle once its animating force is destroyed, it makes for an excellent ingredient for magical chalk.

15 Mote of When a galeb-duhr's form is dispersed, it leaves behind small clods of dirt that Earth continue to carry trace amounts of elemental energy. These need to be collected quickly in specialised containers to prevent further degredation. If collected properly, they can then be used to craft an elemental gem. Requires enchanted vial.

20 Galeb- Unlike a regular earth elemental, galeb-duhr's have a strong tie to the Material Duhr Core Plane, and this is reflected in their possession of a "core." Often referred to as the galeb-duhr's heart, this magical stone serves as the basis of the galeb-duhr and is the physical embodiment of their identity and form. If recovered undamaged, it can be used to create a new galeb-duhr.
Use: The galeb-duhr core must be placed inside a pile of rocks the size of a medium humanoid on the night of a full moon. Until the next full moon, the person that placed the core must cast the conjure elemental spell on top of the chosen pile of rocks every day at the same hour as the placing and maintain concentration on the spell for the full hour. When cast in this way, no elemental actually appears, but the spell slot is still expended. If done correctly, the pile of rocks will coalesce into a galeb-duhr upon casting conjure elemental on the next full moon. The galeb-duhr is friendly to its summoner and understands anything its summoner says to it even if they do not share a language. The summoned galeb-duhr obeys any order its summoner gives to it to the best of its abilities. A galeb-duhr summoned in this way also remembers any memories its core had experienced in its previous lives. This galeb-duhr does not disappear at the end of the hour and is only dispersed upon its death.

## Gargoyle

DC Item Description
15 Shard of Gargoyles are formed around the many shards of broken rock that the Prince of Elemental Elemental Earth, Ogremoch, leaves in his wake. While it only contains the tiniest

Evil fraction of his power, it still contains strong magic, and many alchemists value them as thickening agents in their potions. If needed, the shard may also be used in the scrying spell when divining for Ogremoch.

20 Gargoyle The gargoyle is a paradox; a creature made of stone and yet able to fly at amazing Wings speeds. Although its wings are heavy, they manage to catch air just the way a bird's (x2) feathers might. While they are incredibly difficult for even the most experienced stonemasons to work with, they can be refashioned into a stone-like cloak that exhibits many strange qualities.

# GENIES 

"I will admit, on more than one occasion I have found myself an involuntary servant of a genie noble. It was always a tedious bore to be in one of their courts; stripped of all possessions and forced to entertain them with tales of my travels. My eventual escape never could come soon enough, but alas the joke would be on me as their elemental bodies would inevitably disintegrate upon my vanquishing of them, leaving little behind for me to take home. In the end, I would have to settle for a trinket from one of their vast treasure hoards and call it a day."- Hamund

15 Crystalline When a dao dies, its body disintigrates into a crystalline powder. Fast hands can Powder capture this powder before it loses its magical essence which can then be used as (vial) a material component in many spells. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: When casting the spell conjure elemental, you may use the crystalline powder as a material component to cast the spell as an action instead.

## GHOST

DC Item Description
10 Ectoplasmic Rather than bleed blood as a living being would, a ghost instead drips a thin Trail (vial) trail of slimy substance known as ectoplasm. Scholars still argue what exactly ectoplasm is, but the current prevailing theory is that it is created when matter from the Ethereal Plane collides with that in the Material Plane during the ghost's jaunts between them. Requires enchanted vial.

20 Spirit Echo A ghost has no corporeal form and thus leaves little behind to harvest from its actual body. Instead, using spirit paper, an echo of the ghost can be imprinted and stored for later use. Like any instance of using spirit paper, such an imprint is not the soul itself, but a fragile simulacrum. The imprint does possess all of the ghost's memories however, and responds to the speak with dead spell. Requires spirit paper.

# Gnome, Deep 

"I have known many deep gnomes in my time, and found them all to be good company, if a little dourer than their surfacedwelling cousins.

# Harvest Table: H 

## HAGs

"The rules for hags is the same as that of disasters: they're dangerous, they're best to be avoided, and they tend to come in threes. Harvesting a hag is also a dangerous proposition as contact with their bodily fluids carries the risk of contracting the dreaded 'crone's disease.' Great care should always be exercised when carving up one of these ladies, otherwise you run the risk of looking like my childhood nanny for the rest of your life"-Hamund

Perhaps reflective of their spiteful nature in life, hags continue to display an unmatched level of vindictiveness even in death. Upon their death, a reaction takes place immediately in the bodily fluids of a hag that makes them a vector for transmitting "Crone's Disease." Whenever a creature imbibes any bodily fluids from a deceased hag, they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with crone's disease. A character whose harvesting check fails to harvest anything from the hag also runs the risk of contracting crone's disease as they clumsily splash blood in an orifice or in an open wound.

Upon contracting crone's disease, 1 of the victim's facial features/body parts immediately transforms to look more hag like. For example, their nose may become hooked, or their hands become claw-like. Every 24 hours, the victim may attempt the saving throw again. On a success, the disease ends, and every 24 hours subsequently, 1 transformed feature returns to normal. On a failure, another facial feature or body part changes to become more hag-like, and the disease continues. Every 7 days, any currently transformed feature becomes permanent even after the disease is cured. At that point, only restorative magic such as that of the spell greater restoration may return the creature to their normal appearance.

## Green Hag

DC Item Description

15 Green Green hags are notorious for their ability to mimic sounds to lure or scare intruders Hag to their lairs. This ability lingers behind in their skulls and artificers can draw out Skull this latent power to create a magical trinket with much of the same property. In several ways, the hag would probably have enjoyed the idea of its carcass being used for such a macabre activity.

# HARPY

pouch)
15 Harpy If harpies are known for one thing, it is their singing. Their vocal cords are able to Vocal produce a wide variety of sounds, and some daring bards have taken to using them Cords as strings for their instruments. Bards with instruments of the harpies are said to play music that can entrance entire rooms of listeners.
20 Harpy On a rare occasion, you may slay a harpy that was in the middle of ovulation. Egg Whether the egg is fertilised is irrelevant, as it is the eggshell that holds the true value. When this pink-speckled shell is powdered, it makes a dye with potent magical abilities.

## Hell Hound

DC Item Description
5 Hell When a hell hound dies, it is consumed by its internal fire leaving nothing behind but Hound ash of burnt fur. While this is disapointing to harvesters, the fur still has some utility. Fur (3 Use: As an action, you may rub 1 tuft of hell hound fur into your hands. If you do so, tufts) for the next minute, whenever you roll a 1 or 2 on a fire damage dice roll, you may reroll that die and you must use the new number. After being used, the tuft of hell hound fur loses its magic and becomes useless.

## Helmed Horror

DC Item Description
10 Helmed When crafting a helmed horror, no ordinary helmet will do. One made specifically for Horror the purpose must be comissioned in order to grant the unique senses that the Helmet helmed horror possesses. With some time, an artificer can take one of these helms and reconfigure the arcane signatures so that they work for regular humanoids.
15 Helmed The animating spirit of a helmed horror dissipates quickly after its form loses Horror structural integrity. If done quickly however, this spirit can be caught using a sheet of Essence spirit paper. No matter how quick you may be however, some of the spirit will have degraded already, thus any attempt at reusing the spirit is sure to result in a lower quality construct than the original helmed horror. Requires spirit paper.
Use: You may spend an hour performing a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check with the spirit paper to transfer the essence to an unworn suit of plate armour. If you are successful, the essence leaves the spirit paper and enters the suit of armour, creating an animated armour under your control. This armour follows your instructions to the best of its ability, but lacks the intelligenc to discern any nuance from your words and follows orders to the letter. This animated armour remains until it is destroyed.

15 Hippogriff It is said that a hippogriff can spot a mouse in a field from more than 2 miles over. Eye (x2) Whether true or not, they can definitely spot an orcish ambush coming from a few hundred feet out, and this is another reason that hippogriffs are so highly valued as mounts and companions.

# HOMUNGUlUS 

DC Item Description
10 Homunculus Material

20 Homunculus The homunculus' blood is the same as its master's: a wizard must bleed onto an Varies Blood (vial) empty construct in order to bring it to life. While this imparts a connection to that wizard that they would find useful, it can also be exploited by others skilled in the arcane arts who manage to capture said homunculus. As such, the price of this blood can vary wildly depending on which wizard's homunculus it was taken from. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: As an action you may drink the homunculus blood. Doing so gives you all the knowledge that the homunculus had up to the point of its death, including the languages it knew, and the knowledge that its creator shared with it. You may not necessarily understand all of this knowledge, especially if it is of a very esoteric nature and you may not necessarily be able to parse all of it. You retain this knowledge for 10 minutes, after which all of it vanishes from your mind. Once this happens, you become stunned for 1 minute as your mind recovers from the influx of information it received.

15 Hydra An organ capable of scaling up blood circulation regardless of how many heads its Heart body grows, the heart of a hydra is brimming with magical potential.

# Harvest Table: I 

## InTELLECT DeVOURER

DC Item Description
Value Weight Crafting
15 Brain Fluid (vial) the fluid that oozes through an intellect devourer is not unlike the mucus secreted by their illithid masters. This fluid however has the unique ability to carry and pass on memories to those that consume it.
Use: As an action you may drink a vial of brain fluid. If you do so you must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you become stunned for 1 minute as your mind fails to process the information flooding through it. On a success, you learn the identity of who this intellect devourer used to be, as well as one key memory. The key memory is up to the discretion of the DM, but may be something that the intellect devourer knew in its original life, or something it has learned after becoming an intellect devourer.
20 Living Living is a strong word in this case. Used here, it really means that the brain still has Brainstem some capacity for interaction and response to stimuli, due largely to the dark rituals used to transform it into an intellect devourer. While it would be much more merciful to put the brain out of its misery by destroying it entirely, it still offers some use for an adventurer with a strong stomach.
Use: For 6 hours after an intellect devourer's death, its main brain continues to send weak signals of psionic wavelengths. When the brain is worn directly on top of a humanoid's head, that humanoid becomes immune to the detect sentience ability of intellect devourers. Instead, an intellect devourer that detects that humanoid will assume that humanoid is a host of a living intellect devourer and will treat them accordingly. However, an intellect devourer that can see without using its blindsight will still notice that a humanoid is wearing a brain on the top of their head and will also react accordingly.

They ran as soon as I raised my fist at them of course, but by then, they had already taken everything off me, including my clothes. Needless to say, it was a rather awkward journey back to my lodgings that morning."- Hamund

# KRAKEN 

DC Item Description
10 Kraken If anything betrays the kraken's blasphemous nature, it is the vile ichor that it tries to Blood pass off as blood. Reeking of rotten fish and feeling just as slimy, the kraken's blood ( 9 nontheless is coveted by alchemists for its intense alchemical potential. vials)
10 Kraken The ink of the kraken is vastly different to that secreted by a mere octopus. With a Ink ( 6 darkness that seems to leech the light around it, and a chemical mixture venomous vials) to most creatures, this ink naturally has been weaponised by intrepid alchemists.
10 Kraken A kraken's tooth is hard and sharp enough to cleave right through the hull of a ship. Tooth With that in mind, they make fantastic heads for ballistae bolts and harpoons, and (x10) navies reserve their "kraken bolts" for only the flagship of their enemies.
15 Kraken A kraken's hide is at once tough and rubbery, capable of absorbing even magically Hide imbued strikes with ease. Only the greatest of tanners are able to work with this hide, and only certain choice sections of it, but those who can are capable of crafting an extremely powerful set of clothes for the marining adventurer.
20 Kraken As both armies and gods can attest, the scales of a kraken are nigh unpenetrable, Crown even with magically powered strikes. Particularly prized is the scale located on the Scale crown of the kraken's head which is both incredibly hard and the easiest to work with. Removing them is incredibly difficult however, and takes no small amount of elbow grease. Once pried off, they may be recrafted into a special shield by a blacksmith that has reached the zenith of their craft.
25 Kraken The kraken has most likely forgotten more than ordinary mortals will ever hope to Eye x2 learn. From its watery domains, it has scoured ocean caverns hiding mysteries and treasures that surface dwellers were never meant to see. By taking a kraken's eye and subjecting it to a number of arcane rituals, these secrets can be revealed to a mind capable of handling them.
25 Kraken Not many are aware that a kraken possesses 3 hearts, each with a slightly different Heart circulatory function. In artificing function however they all serve the same purpose. (x3) By transfiguring them into crystals, they can be placed around a certain perimeter to act as wards against disastrous environmental effects. Many of the oldest port cities owe their longevity to these wards, or they would have been swept away by the tides long ago.
Use: An artificer may spend 1 year performing a daily ritual to transform a kraken heart into a large red crystal with the ability to dampen natural forces. When 3 of these crystals are placed within 5 miles of each other, the area enclosed by them always experiences fair weather. Rain in that area never results in flooding, and waves are magically prevented from washing past the perimeter of that area.

In order to facilitate this odd physiology on Stem such a large scale, the main brain of the kraken has a certain electromagnetic quality to it that not only allows it to control its massive body, but also influence sea creatures and the area around it.

"Be wary when harvesting a kuo-toa; their insides smell stronger of rotten fish than their outsides. If you do find your hands stained with their horrid stench after harvesting them, a good tip is to soak them in the nearby ocean for a while. For whatever reason, doing so seems to nullify the worst effects of it, but you may still be followed by seagulls for a while alters."-Hamund

## LICH

"Liches, are base and cowardly beings, not to mention extremely hypocritical. After all, there is no better path to immortality than as a trophy on my wall, but instead liches simply dissolve into dust upon their deaths, leaving me nothing to work with!"Hamund

DC Item Description
5 Lich A lich's body is as much a part of it as a strand of hair on a normal human. It holds no Dust significant connection to it, and discards it with little fanfare. This is because the lich's true power is located within its phylactery, its body acting as little more than a physical conduit for its actions. When a lich is defeated however, not all of its wicked spirit dissipates immediately. Quick action and powerful magic can bind the errant wisps of a lich's essence, allowing one to craft a trinket to track the lich wherever they may reform.

## LIZARDFOLK

"For some reason, lizardfolk-skin bags and shoes have never caught on as a fashion item in any society that I have visited.

"As a whole, I do not make a sport of hunting lycanthropes. Even though their beastly nature would make them fair game, they revert to their original form upon death, and as a whole I tend to avoid hunting and harvesting humanoids (for both ethical and legal reasons)" - Hamund

## Medusa

"Medusas are interesting creatures to harvest for several reasons. The first is that it is quite difficult to harvest something you are not allowed to look at directly, as the medusa's petrifying gaze persists even after its death. The second, is that their granite-like composition means that a medusa's body does not decompose the way a normal creature would. As such, a freshly harvested medusa head can remain recognisable (and thus usable) for many years."- Hamund

Due to the fact that a medusa's petrifying gaze remains active even beyond the death of the medusa, any character attempting to harvest the medusa must do so while averting their gaze. Doing so imposes disadvantage on any check made to harvest the medusa, unless that character is capable of another reliable method of perception.

If the eater dies, they will return to life in 1d6 days and regain all hit points, missing body parts, and be cured of all non-magical diseases. Only a wish spell can prevent this trait from functioning. In addition, the naga from whom the heart was taken loses its rejuvenation ability until the creature that ate their heart returns to life for the first time using this ability. After the eater returns to life for the first time using this ability, they lose this ability.

# NightMARE 

DC Item Description
10 Nightmare Nightmares have the ability to grant fire resistance to any creature riding them, Ashes ostensibly to avoid burning their riders to death. Upon their death, taking some (small of their ashes and leaving them in a crucible overnight can create one of the key pouch) ingredients of a potion of fire resistance.

## Nothic

DC Item Description
10 Nothic The nothic brain is immense; existing as both a testament and mockery to the Brain nothic's former intellectual callings. Despite its veil of madness, wells of knowledge still exist within it, for those that know how to bring it out.
Use: You may spend 1 day pulping, drying, and mixing this item with various reagents. The resulting mixture creates a magical ink that contains magical knowledge. A character with at least 3 levels in the wizard class may use this ink to write in their spellbook. If they do so, they subconsciously write down a random spell (chosen by the DM) of 2nd level or lower into their spellbook. Regardless of the level of the spell, this transcription takes 2 hours and costs nothing except the usage of all the ink. This copied spell functions as well as any other spell copied into the book through a mundane method.
15 Nothic The bulging, lidless eye of a nothic is its main source of power. Capable of seeing Eye more than mortals were meant to, it provides a good framework for constructing magical devices capable of performing similar feats as its original owner.

# Harvest Table: O 

## OGREs

## OGRE

DC Item Description
5 Ogre An ogre has a repugnant odor that seems to combine mouldy cheese, sour feet, and Fat dank mud all at once. The fat around their rotund bellies seem to be the most potent ( 3 source of this smell, and it takes a very stalwart alchemist to render this fat into tallow vials) to make a vaguely magical candle.
10 Ogre The tough skin of an ogre is undoubtedly smelly and unpleasant. However, when Hide tanned, it makes for a very durable leather, and many tanners would be glad to have them.
15 Ogre Brutish, rough, and very large, the hands of an ogre are meant for little more than Hand wielding a club to smash those smaller than their owner.
(x2)

## HALF-OGRE

DC Item Description
10 Half- The blood of a regular ogre is too foreign and extreme to be compatible with that of Ogre a humanoid's system. A half-ogre on the other hand has the perfect dilution of Blood humanoid blood for it to not be toxic to a humanoid, while still conferring the power ( 5 vials) of its giant pregenitor.

## Oni

DC Item Description
5 Oni The horns of an oni are incredibly hard and serve only to add to the oni's devilish Horn appearance. They carry only trace amounts of the oni's innate magic, but they make good magical implements. Cannibalistic cults have often taken to using these horns as ceremonial flasks in their depraved rituals.
10 Oni Despite being ogres, oni blood carries regenerative properties usually only seen in Blood trolls. This powerful blood is one of the many potential catalysts used for brewing the ( 5 ubiquitous healing potion.
vials)
15 Oni The eyes of an oni appear to glow long after they have been pried from their foul Eye sockets. If you are willing to use them, they can be crafted into goggles useful for the (x2) adventurer with no darkvision.
20 Oni The hands of an oni are much like any other ogre's; tough and powerful. When taken Hand to a blacksmith with a magical bent, they can be crafted into gauntlets of ogre power (x2) just like any other ogre's.

# Oozes 

"Oozes are a staple of any good adventure experience, and every good adventurer should know how to repurpose the nasty things for their own uses. Best to exercise caution when harvesting them however, as their slime remains active even after the animating force behind them is gone." - Hamund

## Black Pudding

DC Item Description
10 Black A sample of a black pudding. Inert due to lacking enough biomass to constitute a full Residue ooze, it nevertheless retains its acidic properties. Can be used as a potent acid. (vial) Requires enchanted vial.

## Gelatinous Cube

DC Item Description
10 Gelatinous The gelatinous residue from a gelatinous cube carries much of the same acidic Residue properties from its original form. Unlike samples taken from other oozes, the (vial) gelatinous cube's acid is difficult to identify when mixed with other liquids, making it the substance of choice among assassins with a subtler touch. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: Drinking the gelatinous residue automatically deals 6d6 acid damage to the drinker. The gelatinous residue may be mixed with up to 5 oz . of other liquid and still retain this property. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can identify a liquid that has had gelatinous residue mixed into it.

## Gray Ooze

DC Item Description
10 Gray Not as potent as a black pudding, but highly acidic nonetheless. Some blacksmithing Residue techniques actually use this acid in advanced smithing projects, but the difficulty and (vial) volatility of controlling the residue has made this a rather esoteric artform. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: A vial of gray residue can be poured on a piece of nonmagical metal. This ooze will eat through 2 inches of that metal every round for the next 10 rounds, after which it becomes too diluted to continue.

## Ochre Residue

DC Item Description
10 Ochre The wobbly material of an ochre jelly is not as potent as other oozes. Indeed, it is Residue weak enough that it can be treated with large amounts of other ingredients and (vial) consumed safely. It is not actually uncommon to stumble upon a tribe of kobolds that have set themselves up in a dungeon and farm the local ochre jellies in order to brew a rather noxious ale.

20 Purple Despite what you may think, it is not much safer to be on the opposite side of a Worm purple worm's mouth, as its tail is perhaps even more deadly. When the stinger head Stinger is taken and recrafted into a weapon, it can deliver payloads of venom just as it did when attached to its original owner.
25 Purple With all the dirt and rock that a purple worm chews through, it inevitably swallows Worm some precious gems and metals.

10 Rust Rust monsters have the simultaneously wondrous and aggravating ability to sense Monster any ferrous metal within 30 feet of it. This is a property of their antennae, which Antenna can be repurposed into metal detectors for ordinary humanoids (their corrosive (x2) abilities being neutralised in the process of course).
15 Rust Taking the carapace of a rust monster and grinding it down into a dust is an all too 3 gp 10 lb . Monster common tactic for subterranean cultures. This dust continues to carry the corrosive Dust property of the rust monster, and can be used as either a defense neutralising (large weapon, or as a cruel practical joke.
bag) Use: As an action you may toss a handful of rust monster dust at a ferrous nonmagical metal item within 5 feet. Upon contact, the dust corrodes and destroys a 1foot cube of the material. If the item is being worn or carried by a creature, that creature may attempt a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid this effect. If the object touched is a weapon or armour/shield, it suffers a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls or AC offered respectively. If this penalty reaches -5 for a weapon, drops a piece of armour's offered AC to 10, or drops a shield's AC bonus to 0 , then that item is destroyed. A single bag of rust monster dust has enough dust to be used 5 times.

## Sahuagin

"I once had a fishing trip ruined by a run in with a sahuagin. I had just landed a massive bass that I was eager to mount on my wall and turned around for a single moment to gather my cleaning supplies. When I turned back however, my prize was gone and replaced by one rather gluttonous sahuagin. I won't go into the details, but needless to say I ended up mounting something on my wall that day."- Hamund

## Shambling MOUnd

"Some scholars have attempted to study the lightning birth of shambling mounds, believing that their incredible regeneration and growth abilities may be used to increase food production several times. Unfortunately, so far the only results of their experiments have been electrified fields and irate farmers." - Hamund

Due to their large sizes and amorphous nature, a shambling mound can potentially be harvested several times. If you successfully harvest the "shambling mound mulch" or the "shambling mound vine" items, you may attempt to harvest them again, with the DC raising by 2 for each attempt.

20 Root-stem The root-stem of the shambling mound is actually the entirety of its being in the same way that a humanoid's brain is the entirety of theirs. It is prized in medicine for its regenerative properties and at the same time prized in necromantic schools for its decaying and consuming properties.

DC Item Description

## SphinXes

## ANDROSPHINX

DC Item Description
10 Sphinx Tail The long leonine tail of a sphinx is incredibly distinctive and carries a great amount of cultural significance in some circles. Some sects and cults have a ritual of encasing the tail in dark wax and burning it as a candle wick. It is said that the visions they see in these seances reveal long forgotten secrets buried by time. Others say that sphinx fur just has a mild hallucigenic effect. Unfortunately, there is a distinct dearth of samples to test these hypotheses.
15 Sphinx The heart of a sphinx is quite literally full with secrets and mystery. Skilled Heart artificers can bring out this magic in the form of an amulet to aid those who have managed to defeat the sphinx.
20 Sphinx Pelt The sphinx pelt is both regal and mysterious. Those who wear it share in the noble countenance of the creature they have felled, as well as their independence from time and space.
25 Sphinx Wing The majestic wings of a sphinx rival that of celestial angels themselves. Like (x2) many magical wings, they make prime base materials for a set of artificial wings that grant the power of flight. These ones however have the added bonus of their sphinx owner's abilities of teleportation.
30 Androsphinx While the androsphinx has access to powerful spells, truly its most feared Vocal Cords ability is its roar. A sonic blast imbued with the blessings of the gods themselves, the roar of a sphinx can wreak havoc on a mortal's body. The most learned of artificers have discovered the secret to transforming their powerful vocal cords into instruments to produce the same power. Some believe that the sphinxes themselves imparted this knowledge; why they would do so is a mystery.

## Sprite

DC Item Description
10 Sprite The ground up wings of a sprite produce a dust that is capable of replicating Dust the sprite's notable ability to read the hearts of those they touch. Of course, if (small you've ground up a dead sprite's wings, no one would need magical dust to pouch) read your heart.

Use: If sprinkled over a creature, that creature gains the ability to magically know the emotional state of the next target creature they touch. If the target fails a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, the user of the dust also knows the touched creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.
15 Sprite Sprites are notorious for being hard to catch. Part of this is their small size and Wing agility, but mostly it is due to their ability to turn invisible whenever they wish. (x2) This magic is housed in their wings, giving rise to a saying popular in forested cultures: "as obvious as a wingless sprite."

## Stirge

# HARVEST Table: T 

## TARRASQUE

"So powerful is the tarrasque; so awe inspiring, devastating, and unstoppable, that every single part of it has entered the lore of one culture or another. The tarrasque is in fact one of the few creatures in this Multiverse that I cannot boast about killing, and in truth, even I would not attempt to. The entries here on tarrasque parts are based purely on legends I have heard on my travels; ancient cultures that have inherited stories from even more ancient cultures. I shudder to know of which prehistoric society ever managed to fell a tarrasque and harvest it for their own use, and I shudder even more to know what force managed to wipe that society from the history books."-Hamund

The tarrasque is so large that it cannot be easily harvested by any single adventurer, or indeed even a group of adventurers. The harvesting of a tarrasque for usable parts is an endeavour that would require a full company of workers a long period of time to complete, and that's before the time it takes to ship everything back and then make the parts usable.

The harvesting of a tarrasque takes 10 labourers proficient in harvesting a total of 30 days to complete (assuming that they work for 8 hours a day). Every 6 days, the labourers successfully manage to harvest 1 of the items on the tarrasque's harvest table. Due to the irregular method of harvesting a tarrasque, no check is made when attempting to do so, the labourers must simply put in enough work to finish the job.

Tarrasque parts do not face deterioration regardless of length spent exposed to the elements, nor any lack of preservation. Even nature itself does not wish to oppose a tarrasque.

N/A Tarrasque The dusty temple walls of some forgotten societies often depict what some Heart believe to be a tarrasque heart. The heart seems to be placed in a position of reverence, the shadow of a tarrasque acting as a guardian for the city. Use: Activating a tarrasque heart requires the work of 10 spellcasters who have access to at least one 6th level spell slot or higher. Each spellcaster must spend 10 hours in constant contact and focus on the tarrasque heart. At the end of the 10 hours, they each expend a 6 th level spell slot or higher. This process must be repeated for 50 consecutive days, after which, the heart will activate and create a protective enchantment in a dome centered on itself and with a radius of 3 miles. While they are alive and inside the protective enchantment, the spellcasters that activated the heart may choose to spend an action to target any number of creatures inside the protective enchantment and force them to succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened, with the entire area under the protective enchantment considered the source of the effect. While frightened in this way, a creature drops anything they are carrying and must use their full movement as well as any potential dash actions to run as far away from the protective enchantment as possible. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if they are within the protective enchantment. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. If any of the 10 spellcasters die after activating the heart, the heart deactivates and the activation process must start again.
N/A Tarrasque A tarrasque shell is the hardest substance known to man, harder than even the Shell legendary mithral and adamantine. As such, it is virtually impossible to chip off any shards to be used as personal shields or armour, and may only be used in its entirety. Modern scholars believe that the fabled elven ship, 'Skellbladnir' was actually crafted from the shell of a tarrasque, explaining many of its purported magical properties.
N/A Tarrasque A tarrasque horn is said to make a battering ram powerful enough to breach the Horn gates of Hades itself and free all evil that dwell within. While that remains to be tested, it is certainly strong enough to break down any structure made by mortals. Even today, horn fragments are always found in the same kind of place: the destroyed gates of an abandoned city.
Use: The tarrasque horn may be used as a ram (Dungeon Master's Guide, Page 255). This ram has a +14 to hit and deals 55 (10d10) bludegoning damage and deals double damage against objects and structures.
N/A Tarrasque The eyes of a tarrasque have witnessed countless civilisations lost to the annals Eye (x2) of history (usually because they were destroyed by the tarrasque). That said, even though the tarrasque probably could not understand the majesty of what it was seeing, it still bore witness to them, and combined with its powerful inherent magic, that is enough for diviners to draw out the most ancient of secrets.
Use: A creature casting the spell legend lore may instead choose to use the tarrasque eye instead of the spell's usual components. This does not consume the eye.

from the flesh of a tarrasque that they consumed before every battle. Where they
got the strength to take down a tarrasque in the first place is another mystery entirely.
Use: If a creature consumes 1 pound of tarrasque flesh, they gain a Strength score of 30 for the next 24 hours.

DC Item Description
15 Troglodyte Troglodyte hides are capable of changing colours to match their surroundings, Hide allowing them to create ambushes on those less wary.

# Harvest Table: V 

## VamPires

"I have never been a fan of tussling with vampires. Creatures of the night, they rarely present an honest fight, not to mention the annoying fact that most items harvested from their long-overdue corpses whisper temptations to those that possess them. When I go monster hunting, I am looking for trophies, not gossipy boarders."-Hamund

Items crafted or taken from a vampire carry with them a dark undead energy that makes using them a risky proposition. Anytime a creature attuned to an item made from a vampire part attempts a long rest, there is a 10 percent chance that they will be afflicted with the Gravemaster's Curse. At the DM's discretion, this roll may be made in secret, with the result unknown to the relevant player.

A creature cursed in this way can't voluntarily end their attunement to the item that cursed them, and they feel a need to be within arm's length of that item at all times. Whenever the cursed creature sleeps, they hear whispers of temptation from the vampire from whom the cursed item was made but forgets it as soon as they awaken. A cursed creature is not necessarily aware they have been cursed. After 7 consecutive days of being cursed, a cursed creature will take any opportunity to be alone and to get away from anybody that would be able to identify and remove the curse.

If a creature remains cursed by this item for the continuous length of one full lunar cycle, they are possessed by the soul of the vampire from whom the item that cursed them was created. When this happens, the creature is incapacitated and loses control of their body which also transforms into a full vampire. The possessing vampire spirit retains all of their old memories, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as any spellcasting abilities it may have had. It otherwise adopts the possessed target's statistics, as well as any of their knowledge, class features, and proficiencies. The returned vampire also retains attunement to any items the original possessed target had, including the item that cursed them in the first place.

The original soul of the possessed body is then imprisoned inside the item that cursed them. While imprisoned in this way, the original soul is aware of its immediate surroundings and can communicate telepathically with any creature in contact with them and vice versa. If the item is ever destroyed, the possessed soul is destroyed as well. The only way to lift the curse and restore the soul to its body is with either a wish spell, or if the possessing vampire breaks their attunement to the cursing item. If the curse is lifted in this way, the soul of the vampire is destroyed permanently and the original soul retakes control of their body. If the original body is destroyed, the original soul is sent to the afterlife.

Only one item made from a vampire can curse a target at any given time and a creature may only be cursed by one vampire's item at a time. While cursed, any attempt to attune to an item made from another vampire fails. A creature that has had this curse lifted from them may not attune to any other item made from a vampire again.

10 Vampire The necrotic blood of a vampire, as dark and thick as blood can possibly become.

Use: A vampire spawn heart that has had the spell remove curse cast on it once a day for 7 consecutive days, resonates with an energy counter to the darkness that once pervaded it. In this condition, a vampire spawn heart will attempt to warn anyone holding it of the approach of its old master. It will begin to beat slowly if the original vampire is within 300 feet of the holder, and beat progressively faster as the original vampire draws near.

"Unlike most fiends, the ichor that a yugoloth leaves behind actually serves some purpose. As befitting their greedy natures, some lower-tier yugoloths have actually made a business of allowing themselves to be slain and their ichor collected."Hamund

Like regular devils, yugoloths slain outside of their native plane also dissolve into an ichor rather than leave behind a corpse. Given the yugoloths artificial nature however, this ichor tends to be more useful than devil ichor and can be harvested for some benefit. Either way, a yugoloth slain outside of Gehaena cannot be harvested for anything except their respective ichor. Yugoloths slain on Gehenna can be harvested like a regular creature, including their ichor, traces of which can still be found in their veins.

5 Arcanaloth The ichor of an arcanaloth is the most valuable of all yugoloth ichors, being Ichor (vial) steeped in the knowledge and magic of the original arcanaloth. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this ichor becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. When you begin writing with this ink, you subconcsiously write down a spell that was known to the arcanaloth. After 2 hours of writing with this ink, you may pick any wizard spell from the arcanaloth's known spell list that is of a level for which you have spell slots, and add it to your spellbook as if you had copied it in a traditional manner.

10 Arcanaloth Despite their learned and sophisticated nature, an arcanaloth is more than Poison capable of killing a mortal in close combat as they are using their spells. This (vial) is partly in thanks to the poison glands they possess under their claws, which add a touch of death to their razor sharp strikes.
Use: Can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 3 d 6 poison damage on a failed save, or half that on a successful saving throw.

15 Arcanaloth The tricky arcanaloth has a tendency to sneak into places it does not belong, Tail aided by its inherent ability to shapeshift and turn invisible. Part of this magic is kept in their tail, which can be spotted twitching before they use any of their deceptive abilitites.
Use: This tail has 3 charges. While holding this tail you may spend 1 charge to use the tail to cast the spell alter self or invisibility (self only). Once this tail loses all charges, it dissolves into a useless black ichor.

20 Yugoloth Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is Heart the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim.

## MezzoLoth

DC Item Description
5 Mezzoloth The ichor of a mezzoloth appears even more foul and dark than that of other Ichor (vial) yugoloths (if that is even possible). Like many yugoloth ichors, this ichor can be mixed with precious gem dust and oils to make an ink that passes on powerful magics. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this ichor becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. If you are able to prepare a spell of at least 5th level, when you begin writing with this ink you subconcsiously write down the information regarding the spell cloudkill. You may do this for a total of 10 hours, after which you successfully copy the spell into your wizard spellbook as if you had copied it from a regular source.

10 Mezzoloth The gas of a mezzoloth is extraordinarily toxic and is said to have been the Gas (vial) inspiration to whichever wizard invented the spell cloudkill. It will remain potent so long as it is kept in an enchanted vial, however it will dissipate much faster than a sample that came fresh from a living mezzoloth. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a point within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Once the vial is destroyed, the trapped gas expands rapidly to fill a 10 foot radius sphere. The gas acts like the spell cloudkill with the exception that it only lasts for 1 round and requires no creature's concentration to maintain it.

15 Mezzoloth The dark chitin of a mezzoloth is harder than many metals and lends a Chitin distinctively insect-like appearance to an adventurer bold enough to wear it.

20 Yugoloth The magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim.

5 Nycaloth Nycoloth ichor is thicker and stickier than other yugoloth ichor and has a Ichor vague green tinge to it. This is odd considering that the magic it lends itself to (vial) points towards a more slippery nature. Requires enchanted vial.
Use: When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this ichor becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. If you are able to prepare a spell of at least 2nd level, when you begin writing with this ink you subconcsiously write down the information regarding the spell mirror image. You may do this for a total of 4 hours, after which you successfully copy the spell into your wizard spellbook as if you had copied it from a regular source.
10 Nycaloth The claw of a nycaloth actually has dozens of tiny hook-like forms growing on Claw the insides. These hooks cause massive damage when the claws rend (x2) unprotected flesh, making wounds worse with each progressive attack. While it may be considered vicious, the same principle can be applied to other weapons to give them the same combative edge.
15 Nycaloth Like many fiends, the wings of a nycaloth can be used as a base component to Wing make the ever useful infernal wings. Their high quality makes them particulalry useful as a material, meaning the artificer has to put relatively little effort (and money) into making them.
20 Yugoloth Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is Heart the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim.

## Ultraloth

DC Item Description
5 Ultraloth The ichor of an ultraloth is almost as valuable as that of the yugoloth, full of Ichor the inherent magic of the ultraloth. Requires enchanted vial.
(vial) Use: When combined with 50 gp worth of gem dust and special oils, this ichor becomes a special ink invested with powerful magic. When you begin writing with this ink, you subconcsiously write down a spell that was known to the ultraloth. After 2 hours of writing with this ink, you may pick any wizard spell from the ultraloth's known spell list that is of a level for which you have spell slots, and add it to your spellbook as if you had copied it in a traditional manner.
10 Mark of Other than their general form, every ultraloth carries some mark on their Gehenna person that brands them as a general above lesser yugoloths, an individual to be respected and feared. This brand is more than an ordinary mark and carries a degree of magic to it that affects the wills of lesser beings even if they themselves are unaware of it.
Use: While carrying this mark on you, you may choose to gain advantage on any Charisma based ability check attempted on a creature within 30 feet of you that has a CR rating less than that of your character level. That creature does not need to be aware of the mark, but must be able to hear and understand you for this effect to work. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.
15 Ultraloth The transfixing eyes of an ultraloth can stun creatures with lesser wills and Eye (x2) hold them still as the ultraloth moves in for the kill.
20 Yugoloth Despite their wide ranging forms, all yugoloths possess the same heart. It is Heart the magic inherent in this heart that both ties them to their home plane of Gehenna and makes them materially unstable enough to teleport at a whim.

# Harvest Table: Z 

## ZOMBIE

"As zombie is more of a classification than a creature, it is difficult to say exactly what items may be harvested from them, except for the universal putrid fluids that flows through their veins."-Hamund

DC Item Description
5 Zombie An absolutley putrid collection of drippings and fluids from a reanimated corpse. Juice While it smells awful, the necromantic magic in it allows it to act as a powerful (vial) preservation agent. Fittingly, necromancers use this very juice to keep their more valuable experiments fresh, often farming lesser zombies for more of this chemical.

# Chapter 4: Crafting 

$t$t was our long distant ancestors that first discovered how to transform the bones of a fresh kill into a heavy club with which to make more fresh kills. Today of course, we have the wonders of civilisation, and with that comes a litany of more advanced tools, weapons, armour, and equipment to be made from what we kill. Indeed, the resourcefulness of society means that just about every creature's carcass can serve as more than just a trophy if you take it to someone with the right know-how.
-Hamund

## Crafting Rules

While some creature parts are useful fresh from the carcass, many require some alterations before their full potential can be realised. These items can be identified due to having a craftable item listed in their crafting column. As crafting is a very natural complement to harvesting, an entire chapter has been devoted to its rules here.

## Crafters

In order to craft a harvested item into a usable item, it must be worked on by a skilled crafter. Crafters are specialised professionals with the knowledge to turn raw materials into something usable. Crafters also tend to be of a certain type, covering different types of items to be made (see "Crafter Types" below).

Both player characters and NPCs may act as crafters, so long as they fulfil the stipulated requirements for their crafter type.

Crafters also need to have the right equipment and tools in order to craft an item, however that aspect is left up to the discretion of the DM and the suitability of the setting. In more fantastical campaigns, magical forges and laboratories may line every city bazaar, while in more grounded settings, finding appropriate facilities may be a quest in and of itself.

## Materials, Time, and Cost

Each craftable item listed in this guide requires at least one harvestable material from a monster's harvesting table to act as a base component of the item. This base component provides the driving magical force that allows the item to function. The harvesting material and quantity of the materials required are listed in the description of the craftable item. For some craftable items, there are several potential harvestable materials that may act as the base component. In these cases, any of the listed materials may be used.

Craftable items require more than just the base component provided by harvested materials, however. Crafting an item requires a cost covering other requirements such as tools, facilities, and extra materials. Note that this cost does NOT include the cost of actually hiring a crafter, and that such a cost is considered separate. Assuming that the players are providing the base component for a craftable material, the value of this base component can be deducted from the end cost of crafting the item.

Finally, craftable items take a certain amount of time before they can be completed. The breakdown of the time and cost investment to craft an item is listed in the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table on the next page.

| Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Item Rarity | Workweeks* | Cost* |
| Common | 1 | 50 gp |
| Uncommon | 2 | 200 gp |
| Rare | 10 | $2,000 \mathrm{gp}$ |
| Very Rare | 25 | $20,000 \mathrm{gp}$ |
| Legendary | 50 | $100,000 \mathrm{gp}$ |

*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll.
This guide uses the rules for crafting in Xanathar's Guide to Everything as the basis for the crafting rules presented here. DM's are encouraged to adjust these numbers based on the needs of their own games.

## Optional Rule: Crafter Skill

Not all crafters are created equal. While a village blacksmith may be good at fixing scythes and making nails, if you hand them a dragon scale, the best you will get back is a ruined dragon scale and an apologetic look. If you have high quality materials, you're going to need a high quality crafter.

While under the base rules, anyone can craft anything so long as they meet the base proficiency requirements, under this optional rule, crafters are differentiated based on their proficiency bonus. A crafter may craft any item whose rarity is equal to or below their proficiency bonus as outlined in the Crafting Skill Proficiency table on the next page.
![img-33.jpeg](assets/Hamund's%20Harvesting%20Handbook_img-33.jpeg)

## Crafter Type

You don't ask a blacksmith to cut the timbers of your house, and you don't ask an alchemist to craft you a suit of armour. If you want an item crafted, you need the right person for the job. Each craftable item comes with a tag in brackets explaining which type of crafter is capable of making that item.

Crafters are not restricted to a single profession either. Some skills are complimentary, or certain individuals are simply talented enough to cover multiple fields. Unless otherwise stated, crafters with multiple proficiencies use the same score for each field.

The following is a basic rundown of crafter types:

---

| Prof. Skill Level | Item Rarity | Description |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $+2$ Novice | Common | Usually an apprentice, assistant, or self-taught practitioner. Knows how to use the tools properly but has little skill with more difficult materials and no ability to make new ideas. |
| $+3$ Journeyman | Uncommon | A craftsmen that serves their village or works in a specific role within their profession. Knows a few things very well, but most likely would not be able to understand the complexities of more exotic materials. |
| $+4$ Artisan | Rare | The highest level of skill that most ordinary people could hope to attain. Capable of establishing a good trade in a city or in service of a noble. Experienced in almost all aspects of their profession and can work with some confidence on rarer materials. |
| $+5$ Master | Very Rare | While hard work and dedication is always valuable, only a few people possess the inherent talent to push the limits of their craft farther than ordinary people. These talented individuals can be considered masters of their art; capable of not just reproduction, but innovation. |
| $+6$ Grand Master | Legendary | An absolute master of their art. Most likely was either an adventurer in their past, or learned their trade from a supernatural force, as this would be the only way for them to become accustomed to the legendary materials that they work with. Capable of crafting any item that falls under their profession. |

## AlCHEMIST

Alchemy is a profession that deals with the brewing and mixing of potions, concoctions, and tinctures. In general, if an organic material needs to be crushed, powdered, dried, boiled, melted, burned, mixed, etc., it's a job for an alchemist.

As part of their job, alchemists must also be experienced herbalists and have some knowledge of creature parts, but this level of knowledge may vary wildly from alchemist to alchemist. For example, village alchemists may know how to mix up local herbs with dried animal parts to cure a cold, while an elvish grandmaster may have learned the 12 secret uses of dragon blood.

Any character that has proficiency with alchemy tools may be considered an alchemist for crafting purposes.

## ARTIFICER

A catch-all term for anyone who works primarily in the moulding, transfiguration, enchanting, and manufacture of magical items. Often powerful wizards, their job requires them to not only understand magic, but alse be able to weave permanent spells to transform mundane objects into wondrous ones. A common practice among artificers working with harvested materials is to transfigure them into gems and other objects more conducive to humanoid wear.

As part of their job, an artificer would have knowledge of the uses of magical creature parts, spellwork, the use and preparation of magical reagents (crushed gems, incense, etc), magical identification, magical history, and basic metal and woodworking. Of course, not all artificers have the same level of skill. Some may spend their entire lives mass manufacturing the same magical trinkets day in and day out, while others have ventured to far planes and learned ancient lessons in the courts of djinni princes.

Any character that is proficient in the Arcana skill and has access to at least one spell slot may be considered an artificer for crafting purposes.

## BlackSmith

A hammer striking anvil, the roar of a heated forge, and the hiss of cooling metal. These are the sounds of a blacksmith's shop, the masters and crafters of metal. While the job of a blacksmith is usually simplified to a "metalworker," the role encompasses so much more. Blacksmiths craft and fix all manners of equipment ranging from farming equipment, to weapons, to suits of armour. Not only that, but while blacksmiths normally deal strictly with metal, many creature shells, bones, and scales require metal reinforcement and/or attachments before they can be used as weapons and armour. As such, even though they are organic materials, it is still primarily a blacksmith's responsibility to craft with them.

Blacksmith skills can vary wildly. The local blacksmith may only have a small forge from where they repair the hammers and scythes of their neighbours, while the master smiths of dwarven kingdoms smelt adamantium in rivers of magma at the heart of volcanoes.

Any character that is proficient in the smith's tools may be considered a blacksmith for crafting purposes.

## LeatherWorKer

Metal armour doesn't agree with everyone, and many creatures have perfectly good hides that they won't be using anymore. For times like these, a leatherworker is required. It is a long and messy job to take raw hides, tan them, preserve them, cut them, and fashion them into armour and other equipment, but most societies would break down without this crucial industry.

While leatherworkers are often looked down upon for their unpleasant job, these are usually just the leatherworkers that deal with mundane animal hides and skins. Highly skilled leatherworkers however are treated with the utmost respect since without them, your skinned Purple Worm hides would go completely to waste.

Any character that is proficient in the leatherworker's tools may be considered a leatherworker for crafting purposes.

---

## TINKER

Tinkers are a rare profession, but their work possesses incredible value. Tinkers are usually associated with finnicky contraptions and devices, and if they ever use magic it is usually more of an energy source rather than the driving characteristic. Really, tinkers are more concerned with finding new materials with strange properties to experiment with, and their inventions can range from the entertaining to the absolutely revolutionary.

With that in mind, tinkers vary widely in skill. A travelling peddler may have some experience in making mechanical puppets that flail around for the amusement of children, while the daring few that have travelled to Mechanus and returned alive may have unlocked the secrets of artificial life.

Any character that is proficient in the tinker's tools may be considered a tinker for crafting purposes.

## Thaumaturge

When a piece of armour needs the blessings of a god, or a sword needs a spirit coaxed into it, a thaumaturge is needed. These specialised crafters usually do not consider themselves crafters at all, but simply people with special connections to the gods and their divine energy.
Thaumaturges are not limited to just those that worship the gods either, many fiendish cults can boast their own specialised thaumaturge members that craft their cursed daggers and bind damned souls into pieces of jewellery.

As strange as it is to say, the gods do not see everyone as equals, and certainly do not apportion their gifts impartially. A vagrant holy man is probably capable of invoking his god's name to create a few vials of holy water, while a high cleric of Moradin would be able to bless a hammer so that it strikes with the same fury as their furious deity.
Any character that is proficient in the Religion skill has access to at least one spell slot, and is a follower of a deity or otherworldly patron, may be considered a thaumaturge for crafting purposes.

## Crafting Items from Published Books

Some craftable items originate from official source books published by Wizards of the Coast. In order to avoid lifting large sections of their book and reproducing them here, you are encouraged to look them up in their original books. The source book has been tagged next to the craftable item's name: DMG for Dungeon Master's Guide, and XGTE for Xanathar's Guide to Everything.
In order to understand the quantities of harvestable materials required and the type of crafter, the following table has been made:

# Craftable Items A-Z 

Craftable items are presented in alphabetical order. A craftable item's description gives the item's name, its category, its rarity, its base component, the crafter type required to make it, and its magical properties.

## Aboleth Amulet

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Aboleth Brain x1 (Artificer)
This pale turquoise amulet seems to have a faint flicker of something moving in it, like seeing a creature in murky waters. While wearing this amulet, you gain telepathy out to a range of 120 ft ., can understand and speak Deep Speech, and become proficient in Intelligence (History) checks if you weren't proficient already.

You may also spend an action to target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by you. This charm persists until either you or the target dies, or if you are on different planes of existence. You and the charmed target may communicate with each other telepathically over any distance so long as you are wearing and attuned to this item.

You may only have up to 3 targets charmed in this way at a time. If you successfully charm another target while you already have 3 targets charmed, the charm effect ends on the creature that you charmed first. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, they may repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from you. If a creature succeeds on either resisting the charm effect or if the charm effect on them ends, they become immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.

## Amulet of Secrets

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Sphinx Heart x1 (Artificer)
This blood red amulet is set inside a gold frame the colour of desert sand. While wearing and attuned to this amulet, you gain an uncanny ability to disguise your thoughts and emotions. You become immune to any effect that would sense your emotions or read your thoughts, as well as any divination spell that you refuse. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain your intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.

In addition, you may use the amulet to cast the spell zone of truth without using a spell slot or requiring any components. The DC for the casting of this spell in this way is $8+$ your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus, and you are exempt from the effects of the spell. Once you have used this ability 3 times in one day, you may not use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Amulet of Maglubiyet

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Mark of Maglubiyet x1 (Thaumaturge)
While wearing this amulet, you gain the ability to spend your action and martial your allies with your resounding leadership. For 1 minute, you may utter a special command or warning whenever a non-hostile creature that you can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d 4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand you. A creature can benefit from only one of these effects at a time. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated.

## Amulet of the Desert Tyrant

Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Mummy Lord Heart x1 (Artificer)
This item has 9 charges. While wearing this amulet you may spend an action and 1 or more charges to do any of the following:

- You may use the item to cast any of the following spells: spiritual weapon ( 2 charges, plus 1 additional charge for every level cast above 2nd), animate dead ( 3 charges plus 1 additional charge for every level cast above 3rd), guardian of faith (4 charges), insect plague ( 5 charges, plus 1 additional charge for every level cast above 5th), or harm (6 charges).
- You create a cloud of blinding dust and sand around yourself. Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn ( 2 charges).
- You transform yourself into a whirlwind of sand and immediately move up to 60 feet and then revert to normal form. While in whirlwind form, you are immune to all damage, and you can't be grappled, petrified, knocked prone, restrained or stunned. Equipment worn or carried by you remain in your possession ( 2 charges).

A humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24 -hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process.

If the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated. This item contains enough poison for 3 doses.

## Chimera Kite

While in flight mode, a creature strapped into the harness can speak the command word to cause the kite to emit a magical burst of wind behind itself that propels it, and the creature strapped into it, up to 80 feet in the direction that it is facing. This ability may be used up to 3 times before the kite runs out of magical energy. The kite regains 1 use of this ability every 12 hours that it is not used.

While this kite is airborne and horizontal, it travels forward at a rate of 30 feet per round and descends at a rate of 10 feet per round. The user may change the direction they are flying by pulling on the handle.

If the harness is strapped to something that is heavier than 400 pounds, the harness will instead break when the command word is spoken, and the kite will fly away.

Crafted by: Androsphinx Vocal Cords x1 (Artificer)
You may spend your action to blow this horn. If you do, a magical roar is emitted from the horn which can be heard from a distance of 300 feet.

Crafted by: Devil Wings x2 (Leatherworker)

While they normally take the appearance of a black cloak with a crimson tinge, you speak their command word as an action to transform them into replicas of the wings of the devil they were harvested from and attach them to your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. In this form, they give you a flying speed of 60 feet. In addition, if you are subject to an effect that would cause you to suffer fire damage, you may instead spend your reaction to wrap your wings around yourself and become immune to fire damage and lose the flying speed granted by this item until the start of your next turn.

## Kraken Paint

Wondrous item, very rare
Crafted by: Kraken Ink x2 vials (Alchemist)

You may also spill the entire pot of paint into a body of water as an action to create a 60 -foot radius cloud that spreads around corners. This area is considered heavily obscured and each creature that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Living Dentures

Wondrous item, common
Crafted by: Gibbering Mouther Teeth x1 small pouch (Tinker)

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Medusa Head x1 (Blacksmith)
This full helmet is magically fused with the head of a medusa to recreate its petrifying gaze. While wearing this helmet, you may spend your action to open or close the visor; closing the visor causes the medusas visage to be complete and activates this item's ability. While this item's ability is active, any creature within 30 feet of you that you can see and who can see you, must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

The medusa's visage only possesses enough magic to allow its petrifying gaze ability to function for 1 minute. Anytime this item is used, subtract the amount of time it is used from this minute.

Oil, uncommon
Crafted by: Mimic Gel x1 vial (Alchemist)
This vial contains enough gel to cover an item no larger than one square foot in surface area.

While a creature is holding an item melded with mimic gel, they may spend an action to change its appearance to anything else of the same approximate size and configuration. This appearance change is an illusion only and fails to hold up to physical inspection. Otherwise, a creature can use its action to inspect the item and discern its true nature by succeeding on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

## Obfuscation Pigments

Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Displacer Blood x1 vial (Alchemist)
This pot contains enough paint to cover up to 10 square feet of surface area. Any object completely covered by this paint becomes covered in a unique enchantment that makes it elusive and difficult to recognise for the next hour.

Although the object remains the same visually, it becomes psychologically blocked out by any creature that is not already aware of its presence. For example, even if this dagger was seen by random strangers on the street, they would not cognitively recognise it and would most likely ignore it unless forced to interact with it.

Any attempt to find an item covered in this paint by someone actively searching for it is rolled at disadvantage. However, a creature that touches an item covered in this paint, or who is verbally informed of its presence, ceases to be influenced by this paint's ability.

## Ocean Master Paint

Wondrous item, rare
Crafted by: Dragon Turtle Blood x1 gallon (Alchemist) This bucket contains 1 gallon of paint which is capable of coating 10 square feet of material. Coating 100 square feet of material takes 10 minutes. Anytime a creature with either the amphibious or water breathing trait, and an Intelligence score of less than 10 attempts to move within 20 feet of a coated object, they must roll a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, that creature must instead use all of its available speed to move away from the coated object or creature by the safest route possible. If there is no safe route to use, it instead stays where it is and loses the rest of its speed for that turn.

A coated object stays coated for 24 hours. Applying a new coat refreshes the 24 -hour duration.

## Oni Amulet

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

If you are both wearing and attuned to this amulet, you gain the following benefits:

- You may spend a bonus action to summon a magical glaive into your empty hand. You are proficient in wielding this glaive if you weren't already before.

On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell.

Every night at midnight while cursed, you must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become dominated by the death knight from whose blood this potion was crafted, as if under the effect of the dominate person spell, but with an indefinite duration, no concentration required, and unlimited range.

If the total damage dealt to all targets exceeds 65 , the wand transforms into a shambling mound with the same amount of HP that was just dealt, up to a maximum of 136 . This shambling mound has no allegiance to any creature around it and will act in its own interest. If the wand did not deal more than 65 damage, the wand simply crumbles into compost and is destroyed.

## Warning Waterskin

Wondrous item, common
Crafted by: Salamander Scales x1 small pouch
(Leatherworker)
This waterskin can hold up to 4 pints of liquid. Any liquid kept in this waterskin is automatically brought to and kept at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Warning Scarf

Wondrous item, uncommon
Crafted by: Owlbear Neck x1 (Leatherworker)
While you wear this feather covered scarf, you receive a slight tingling sensation in your neck whenever a hostile creature within 30 feet is looking directly at you. A creature that is aware of this scarf's property may make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw to not trigger this scarf's ability when they look at you. If they succeed, they do not trigger the scarf's ability, and they are immune to this scarf's effect for the next 24 hours.

While wearing this scarf, you also gain the ability to twist your head around 180 degrees around without injuring yourself.

## Wings of the Guardian

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Sphinx Wing x2 (Leatherworker)
These wings are joined to a leather harness that allows a humanoid to comfortably wear them on their back. While wearing these wings, you have a flight speed equal to your movement speed.
In addition, you may spend your action to teleport yourself and any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you have used this ability once, you may not use it again until you finish your next short rest.

## Wound Biter Weapon

Weapon (pike, spear, or whip), rare (requires attunement) Crafted by: Horned Devil Tail x1 (Blacksmith)
When you make a successful hit with this weapon on a creature that is not either an undead or a construct, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or lose 2 d 6 hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each time this weapon hits the wounded target, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 2 d 6 .
Any creature adjacent to the wounded target can take an action to staunch the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.

## Vine Tunic

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Shambling Mound Vines x4 (Artificer)
While wearing this tunic, you become immune to lightning damage. Furthermore, if you are subjected to lightning damage, you take no damage and regain a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt instead.

## Viper Strike

Weapon (pike, spear, lance, or javelin), rarity varies (+1) Crafted by: Skeletal Naga Fang x2 (rare), Spirit Naga Fang x2 (very rare), Guardian Naga Fang x2 (very rare) (Blacksmith)
When you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, you deal an additional 10 poison damage, or 14 poison damage if you are using the 'very rare' version of this weapon. If you are using the 'very rare' version of this weapon, you also gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

## Yernoghu's Boon

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
Crafted by: Demon Gnoll Heart x1 (Thaumaturge)
If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on your turn while wearing this charm, you may take a bonus action to move up to half your speed and then make another basic melee weapon attack. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until you have taken a short rest.

# Chapter 5: Tools \& Other Additions 

![img-45.jpeg](assets/Hamund's%20Harvesting%20Handbook_img-45.jpeg)
arvesting is a holistic art. It is not simply the physical act of cutting and slicing through a carcass, it is the tools you use, the rules you live by and the skills you have; in short it is an entire lifestyle! Once you have assumed the life of a harvester, you will see the world in a different way, and find the new possibilities and options open to you. However, in the case that you haven't, I've listed them down here for you anyway."- Hamund

This guide introduces a few new concepts into the base game of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, and as part of that, a few slight alterations and/or additions need to be made to existing concepts and features in the game to accommodate them. While some of these changes are not strictly necessary for this guide to be used, they are advised in order to get the maximum value out of this book.

## Special Tools

A few new pieces of adventuring gear have been added in this book to accommodate the act of harvesting. Their functions are described below:

## Enchanted Vial

Some creature parts have powerful, yet fleeting, magical energies within them. The motes from elementals for example hold traces of their former essences in them but disperse rapidly upon the destruction of their original form.

An enchanted vial is inlaid with several runes designed to keep any magical resource within from dissipating while the lid is closed and is often the only way of transporting certain parts back to a workshop for crafting.

Items that require an enchanted vial to be harvested are fragile by nature and must be stored inside an enchanted vial quickly to prevent degradation. Any attempt to harvest a material that has an enchanted vial as a requirement must be initiated within 1 minute of the death of its creature.

## Hamund's Harvesting Handbook

"Yes, you can own a copy of this very book in any plane you visit! Due to my travels, I have visited almost every world in the multiverse, dropping manuscripts in publishers' hands as I go. No matter where you are, or where you come from, this handy book is sure to help you get the most out of whatever your local fauna has to offer."- Hamund

This book is filled with all sorts of useful information on the creatures that inhabit the multiverse, specifically, which parts of them are useful for harvesting. Using this book grants you advantage on any Appraise ability check.

## Harvesting Kit

This kit contains everything the average harvester needs to prepare and harvest a carcass for usable parts including a skinning knife, a bonesaw, 2 glass vials, pouches of salt, and tweezers. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency to any check made to harvest a creature.

## Spirit Paper

Spirit paper is a versatile tool that resembles a square of bleached papyrus. The secrets of its production were only recently discovered, and reverse engineered from secrets brought back from distant necromantic cults. By performing a small ritual with the spirit paper shortly after slaying certain creatures, a copy of that creature's soul is bound to the spirit paper for later use. These copies are not a true soul and are more akin to an echo. These echoes do retain all of the memories from its original body, and a few crafting techniques utilise these echoes to grant an item a low level of sentience or to mimic the abilities of their incorporeal reflections.

Using spirit paper is often the only way to harvest anything useful from creatures with incorporeal forms. Any harvesting attempt made for a creature part that has spirit paper as a requirement is done using a Wisdom (Religion) check rather than the usual check and is rolled separately for each item. Once a sheet of spirit paper has been used successfully to harvest an item, it cannot be reused, even if the item it contained is released.

Unlike most harvestable materials, materials that require spirit paper to be harvested dissipate very quickly after the death of its creature. Any attempt to harvest a material that has spirit paper as a requirement must be initiated within 1 minute of the death of the creature and takes 10 minutes to successfully complete.

## Special Tools

| Item | Cost | Weight |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Enchanted Vial | 3 gp | - |
| Hamund's Harvesting Handbook | 50 gp | 5 lb. |
| Harvesting Kit | 30 gp | 7 lb. |
| Spirit Paper | 1 gp | - |

## Additions and Changes

The following are a few balance changes to accomodate the harvesting and crafting rules in this guide, as well as a background and feat to incorporate harvesting into your game.

## New Proficiency: Harvesting Kit

This guide adds in the new tool: the harvesting kit. Players may have proficiency in this like any other tool, and it is highly advised for them to have it as it provides a valuable bonus when making the checks outlined in this book. In order to accommodate this additional tool, the following classes and backgrounds have been slightly altered to give them the option to gain proficiency in the Harvesting Kit.

- Rangers may have proficiency with the harvesting kit upon character creation (this skill is not gained in multiclassing)
- Druids may have the option to choose between proficiency in the herbalism kit or the harvesting kit upon character creation (this skill is not gained in multiclassing)

---

- The Hermit background may choose between the herbalism kit and the harvesting kit as its starting tool proficiency and gains the appropriate kit as part of its starting equipment.
- The Outlander background may choose between a musical instrument or the harvesting kit as its initial tool proficiency. They may also choose between a hunting trap, and the harvesting kit in its initial starting equipment.


## New Background: Harvester

Like a miner in their cave or a farmer in their field, you too make your living through reaping the riches of the natural world. Your resources, however, are the monsters and creatures that populate the multiverse. Although there are some who would scoff and call you a mere butcher, you understand the subtle complexities in the fantastical anatomies you find in your adventures, and only you are qualified enough to harvest them.

## Skill Proficiencies: Nature, Survival

Tool Proficiencies: Harvesting Kit
Languages: One of your choice
Equipment: A set of traveller's clothes, a hunting trap, harvesting kit, a cloak made from a creature you harvested,
and a belt pouch containing 5 gp .

## Feature: Connected

You have been harvesting creatures for a long time and as part of that, you have become deeply acquainted with the large industry of crafters and merchants that rely on the wares you bring. Whenever you enter a place of civilisation, you have no trouble finding merchants willing to buy your materials or crafters that can work with your wares. You are also savvy in the bargaining techniques used when haggling over prices and are not easily tricked during negotiations. You often find yourself able to secure a good price, or even a discount on services relating to harvested materials.

## Suggested Characteristics

Harvesters are an odd bunch; half outdoorsman, half entrepreneur. As someone who spends most of their time in the hunting and being elbow deep in dead bodies, you probably have a different worldview compared to most.

## d8 Personality Trait

1 I am often covered in blood and viscera, which other people find off-putting.
2 I see no moral issue about harvesting any once-living creature, even if they were clearly sentient. "Waste not, want not", after all.
3 I often unnerve people with my discussions of the more disgusting aspects of creature anatomy.
4 I am obsessed with self-sufficiency; anything I wear must have come from something I harvested.
5 I say a small prayer before harvesting a fresh kill, thanking it for its sacrifice.
6 The hunt is what excites me more than anything. Harvesting is just how I keep mementos of my prey.
7 I insist on using every little bit of what I kill, it would be an insult to that creature's life otherwise.
8 I have a myriad of harvested trophies from rare game which I show off whenever possible.

## d6 Ideal

1 Life. Harvested meat will feed the hungry, harvested furs will warm the cold. Through death, comes life. (Good)
2 Honor. I refuse to use something harvested from a creature that I did not kill with my own hands. (Lawful)
3 Necessity. Creatures kill and harvest other creatures to survive. You may not like it, but it's just the way things are. (Neutral)
4 Opportunity. If something is already dead, what's the point of letting its corpse go to waste? (Chaotic)
5 Dominance. Nothing shows off your strength like having your own Owlbear-head trophy. (Evil)
6 Money. People always want hides, pelts, and skins; I may as well be the one to profit off it. (Any)

## d6 Bond

1 My clan won't respect me unless I bring back the head of a rare and dangerous creature.
2 Ever since I was a child, I dreamed of wearing a unicorn fur cloak. If you have a better way of getting one, I'd like to hear it.
3 Hunting and harvesting creatures is the only way I know how to make money and feed my family.
4 Visions of a monstrously large creature haunt my dreams. They won't stop until I find it and claim its pelt for my cloak.
5 I am interested in studying the anatomy of rare and magical creatures and I need samples to continue my research.
6 Harvesting creatures has been my family's profession for generations; I'm just continuing this long line of tradition.

## d6 Flaw

1 Once I decide that a creature will become my next trophy, nothing will stop me from getting it.
2 Some would say I get a little too much pleasure in slicing corpses open and tearing out their fresh organs.
3 I'm always looking for the next big hunt, something that will probably get me killed.
4 I tend to exaggerate the quality of my harvested wares to inflate their price.
5 Once I kill something, I will drop everything to take a trophy from it before moving on.
6 I see other living creatures as just organs in a skin bag, waiting to be sold.

## New Feat: Resourgeful

You've always hated leaving anything to waste and have always made sure you get the most out of any situation.

- You gain proficiency in the harvesting kit and the herbalism kit.
- You ignore any penalties for harvesting a creature that died a particularly violent death.
- Both appraising and harvesting a creature take half the time than it normally would.

## Hamund's Helpers

"Throughout my travels I have met many spectacular individuals. Among them are master crafters, each peculiar in their own ways, but all of them capable of weaving miracles from materials. I know not where these remarkable people are today, perhaps they have finally settled down somewhere and opened a steady shop. Or they are like me and continue to indulge their wanderlust; roaming freely in this great world of ours while offering their skills to anyone who has the coin and materials. I list their names here in my book, to recommend their services to any of my dear readers. And if you are lucky enough to meet them, simply mention my name and I am sure you will receive first-rate service." -Hamund

The following are a list of NPC crafters that a DM can easily slot into any campaign or setting. Feel free to use these NPC's as convenient ways for the party to craft their harvested materials into useful items, vendors to buy spare materials, or even quest givers for certain monster parts.

## AlCHEMist

Name: Lidda Littlelid
Race: Halfling
Hamund's Notes: I've known Lidda since she was born, in fact I was even the one who named her (a fact for which she has never forgiven me). Rambunctious as a youth, Lidda regularly came home with frogspawn, gristleweed, milkgrass, and all matters of ingredients to perform her little experiments. Since then, Lidda has grown into a prestigious alchemist, able to mix even the most esoteric ingredients into some sort of useful brew.

Despite being incredibly intelligent, Lidda does have a tendency towards air-headedness. Thus, although she tends to stay in her family home (as most halflings are content to do), Lidda has a tendency to go on walks, become incredibly enthralled by her thoughts and musings, and then find herself hopelessly lost. On these occasions, she can sometimes take upwards of several years before she manages to stumble upon her home again, laden down with new materials to experiment with from her travels.
![img-46.jpeg](assets/Hamund's%20Harvesting%20Handbook_img-46.jpeg)

## ArtifiCER

Name: Shareefah Khalid
Race: Human
Hamund's Notes: If you look up the word "prodigy," you will find a picture of Shareefah (either that or a young picture of me). Born to a wealthy family of artificers, the young Shareefah received an education from the finest tutors in the land, and routinely dismissed each one when she promptly accelerated beyond what they could teach.

Discontent with simply learning the same tired old lessons, Shareefah left her family and her inheritance behind in order to learn everything that the wide multiverse could offer her. She makes her living offering her services to anyone who has an interesting material for her to work with. Those that have met her can attest to her immense prowess in the artificing craft, exemplified perfectly in the portable workshop she designed: an entire hut she can store inside a large ring on her finger.
![img-47.jpeg](assets/Hamund's%20Harvesting%20Handbook_img-47.jpeg)

## BlackSmith

Name: Orsik Holderhek
Race: Dwarf
Hamund's Notes: I will admit that the inclusion of Orsik in this book is the result of biases on my part; he is my cousin after all. Despite that however, Orsik has proven himself to be one of our clan's foremost blacksmiths (partly due to the steady stream of exotic materials I provide him to experiment with). He is equally as comfortable reforging a broken farm scythe as he is at shaping demon scales into an invincible suit of armour.

Holderheks are restless by nature, so it is common for Orsik to leave his forge in search of interesting new locales, stories, and materials. However, wherever he goes, he always brings with him his favourite smithing hammer, a good supply of high-intensity dragon coal, and his prized shrinking anvil (something of his own creation). With these, he is always ready to smith even the rarest of new materials.

![img-48.jpeg](assets/Hamund's%20Harvesting%20Handbook_img-48.jpeg)

## Leatherworker

Name: Malakar Uuthrakt
Race: Half-Elf
Hamund's Notes: Malakar's story is a familiar one to many half-elves. The stigma of his mixed heritage caught him between two worlds, unable to find a place in neither elvish nor human societies. Crushed between two poor options, Malakar picked a third: the wild.

Living as an outdoorsman, Malakar has proven himself to be a hunter and harvester almost on par with myself. One particular field in which he excels however is tanning and leatherworking. Having killed and skinned almost every creature imaginable, Malakar has taught himself how to take the hides of fantastical beasts and mould them into powerful pieces of armour and equipment.

His vagrant lifestyle naturally causes him to be found just about anywhere, and it is not uncommon to find him having set up a temporary storefront in a town while he considers his next adventure.
![img-49.jpeg](assets/Hamund's%20Harvesting%20Handbook_img-49.jpeg)

## Thaumaturge

Name: "Blind" Mardred
Race: Human (?)
Hamund's Notes: I have known Mardred for a long time, which is saying something considering the longevity of my race, and the relative brevity of hers. Sometimes I do question if she is actually human as she claims, or whether I am simply the mark of a long-running private joke of hers. Even more mysterious than her true age is which divine patron she actually serves. Whenever I have asked her for the identity of her god, she would simply smirk and say, "the only one that matters."

Despite everything, I still have found her to be a valuable source of advice, leads, and information. This goes doubly so for her skills as a thaumaturge, able to easily summon forth divine blessings from reams of spirit paper, or able to demand servitude from the harvested remains of demons. Mardred tends to wander from town to town, offering her services to any with the coin to pay, her arrival always heralded by the rhythmic tapping ofher walking stick.
![img-50.jpeg](assets/Hamund's%20Harvesting%20Handbook_img-50.jpeg)

## Tinker

Name: Jarrod Gerkirk
Race: Gnome
Hamund's Notes: If you are going to Jarrod for a spot of conversation, you have gone to the wrong place. On the other hand, if you are going to him for tinkering work, then you could not be in better hands. A smarter gnome I have never met, and his inventions are so fantastical that he blurs the line between mechanical and magical.

Although Jarrod tends to keep to himself and wiles away the years performing experiments in his laboratory, there are times when he becomes overwhelmed by unexplainable feelings of wanderlust. When these episodes arise, Jarrod inevitably hits the open road on his customised wagon/workshop, ready to make new inventions with whatever fresh materials he finds.

# FAQ 

Q: Why didn't you include the meat you can harvest from creatures?
A: I wanted to avoid relatively generic harvesting materials. Largely I assumed that DM's would be able to judge meat harvesting by themselves without any need for a guide.

Q: Can I give suggestions or feedback?
A: Of course! This is a living document and I fully endorse anyone to send in item suggestions or balance feedback. See the Contact Us section for contact details.

Q: Can I change an item to suit my campaign?
A: Feel free to do so. Items were designed to be setting agnostic and able to fit into anything, but edge cases could always occur. I encourage DMs to use this guide as a launching point for their own ideas.

Q: Will you be making a follow-up for Volo's Guide to Monsters and Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes?
A: Yes I will. Stay tuned for updates on those.
Q: How do your rules fit in with the newly released Artificer class on Unearthed Arcana?
A: To be honest, they do not. The updated Artificer class was released very late into the development of this guide and as such, this guide does not incoporate them at all. A future update may attempt to reconcile them.

Q: Why don't you include the beast section?
A: I felt that beasts were too mundane to include in the harvest table, and largely could be replaced by a DM googling an actual butcher table.

Q: How come you didn't include any loot like weapons and armour?
A: Those items are largely context sensitive. After all, not every Hobgoblin walks around with a spear at all times, so I felt best to leave those out and up to the DM to decide based on context.

<thead>
<tr>
<th dir="ltr">d100</th>
<th dir="ltr">Entry</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">1</td>
<td dir="ltr">Slithersoup: a liquid that when consumed in large quantities, makes you feel like your bones are jelly and commonly causes people to writhe on the ground like snakes when taken in higher doses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">2</td>
<td dir="ltr">Feydust: A soft white powder that, in the right light, shines with soft blues and red. The powder tastes like burnt ozone, which makes it evident that it needs to be snorted. Use causes bonuses to IQ based tasks but also makes its user seek it out more and more for increasingly trivial tasks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">3</td>
<td dir="ltr">Halfling Weed: Most often dried, chopped, and smoked. Causes extreme emotions to abate and induces near euphoric mellow-ness and, occasionally, a user will experience mild hallucinations. Side effects include increased appetite and red, puffy eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">4</td>
<td dir="ltr">Blue sand: A substance similar to fine sand found at the beach, only that it’s deep blue colored. Consumed through the nose. One to five doses (depending on Wis or Con modifier) are enough to develop an addiction. Early effects (one to three weeks): Enhanced perception, athletics &amp; acrobatics Following deterioration of body and mind: First (after four weeks of constant consumption): One exhaustion stack per three days without a dose. Second (after six weeks): Negative modifiers (-2) on all attributes and disadvantage on all skills. Third (after 8 weeks): Death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">5</td>
<td dir="ltr">Dream Flake: Thin slivers of a dried, black fungus. When place between cheek and gum, it induces hallucinations and euphoria. When smoked, the user enters an extremely vivid waking dream, which can last for hours. Extended use blackens the teeth and make 'bad trips' more common. Addictive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">6</td>
<td dir="ltr">Wrymwood: looks like a cinnamon stick but smells of fungus. Grind some up and put in a tea. When drunk, it provides a psychedelic trip for 1d4 hours (halved on a DC 15 con ST and doubled when failing by more than 5).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">7</td>
<td dir="ltr">Grellsvice: A drug usually administered as an oral capsule made from the spikes at the end of a grell’s tentacles. Effects last for roughly two hours on a regular 200 mg dose, and leave the user with a four-hour hangover of sorts. The main draw to grellsvice is a tingling sense in the muscles and extra-sensitive motor functionality. This comes with a strong euphoric rush whenever a new body part is moved. The drawback is the lack of motor functionality during the hangover and the incredibly dulled sense of touch accompanied with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">8</td>
<td dir="ltr">Sundrop: a bright yellow/orange liquid, naturally incandescent, as if it was a liquefied ray of sunshine (henceforth the name). Originally used as a magically synthesized antidepressant, Sundrop when consumed tricks the user into believing that they are happy, as it quite literally gives them ‘warm feelings’. Over usage may leave the user feeling withered between uses, as their dependency has rendered them unable to produce dopamine and serotonin. Over time users also commonly begin to build tolerances to Sundrop, requiring greater quantities to be consumed to maintain the effect. Overdosing on Sundrop causes feverish conditions, as the drug radiates through the users veins, ultimately burning them alive from the inside out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">9</td>
<td dir="ltr">Patch: It works similarly to ecstasy, expanding yourself to feel the sensations all around you. It grants the ability to speak with plants and animals for 1d4+1 hours, and the comedown has a DC15 CON save. Failing the save adds one point of exhaustion immediately after waking from the first long rest you take, and lasts until completing the next long rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">10</td>
<td dir="ltr">Lakua: ground silvery bark from a type of tree only found deep in swamps. Low dosages are generally taken orally. Heavier users often make a paste to apply to their gums. Addicts may smear it into cuts. It gives an adrenaline rush and time seems to slow down but the duration of the high is short. Death comes from heart failure or self-neglect. Psychologically addictive not physically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">11</td>
<td dir="ltr">Zooterran: Made from refined Exem plums. Alters one's sense of direction and causes one to only turn right when faced with a left/right choice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">12</td>
<td dir="ltr">Blackroot: This lichen grows on large rocks and boulders found above timberline (the elevation at which trees do not have enough oxygen to grow). When chewed on, it causes the user to have a pleasant, tingling sensation of the lips, tongue, and gums. As well, it can give the user a sense of mental sharpness and alertness. If swallowed, it causes nausea and vomiting if the user fails a DC 13 Constitution check. If used for 1d6 hours continuously, the user must make a DC 15 Constitution check. If failed, they experience nausea, but if passed they gain advantage on Perception checks for the next 1d4 hours. Not inherently addictive, though if used for 1d12 days in a row, the user will feel extremely groggy if they do not use it every morning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">13</td>
<td dir="ltr">Deluge: Packaged in single-dose vials, ingesting this ethereal blue liquid gives subjects temporary access to spell-like abilities of varying degrees; usually cantrips and 1st Level spells, but sometimes more powerful spells depending on the purity of the substance. However, the temporary magic abilities come with a price: each time an individual ingests Deluge they take Constitution damage: 1d4 for average doses, 1d6 and above for purer doses. This is because the magical energy that Deluge is providing is actually taken from their own souls and continued use will cause them to gradually wither away. It’s named Deluge because it feels like a flood of energy and power washes over you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">14</td>
<td dir="ltr">Barb: A thorny stalk from the Cheb barb weed (looks like purple buck thorn). Sold by the branch, you can pull off individual thorns and use them to scrape or pierce the skin. The side effects are similar to pot, but too much can result in paralysis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">15</td>
<td dir="ltr">Scurva: a vial filled with an irridesant liquid. When drunk it causes it user to see colors more vibrantly and lights to shimmer and become more liquid like. Also makes its user completely intoxicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">16</td>
<td dir="ltr">Fizz: A bubbly, sweet drink in a glass bottle. It has a red label, which reads 'Fizz-Cola'. When you drink a Fizz-Cola, you have the urge to drink another. That's it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td dir="auto">17</td>
<td dir="ltr">Espiritu: a drug derived from a certain flower commonly used in holy rituals. When blessed, left to wither for at least three days, and then dehydrated completely and turned into a powder becomes a strange blessing all it's own. If smoked or snorted, this powder grants a single question answered by a Divine being. It also grants a strong feeling of peace and euphoria, as well as a strong sense of hunger.</td>

This is absolutely true; in the Feywild, magic is so commonplace that 'cooking' is considered it's own school of magic, a mix of enchantment and illusion. Such food when eaten provides a taste that is far beyond anything a real tastebud could ever feel, and addiction is fast, difficult to resist and often lethal as mere mortal foods are not even considered food to an addict. Addiction is generally permanent, but can be cured slowly by a specialist who slowly drops the quality of food an addict ears until they can handle mortal foods again.

When correctly dosed, instills a gentle euphoria as senses sharpen and surroundings appear more vibrant, providing advantage on investigation and perception checks for one minute. When overdosed, the user experiences sensory overload, becoming confused for one minute. Faerie Dust, despite the generic name, is actually the collected breath of a faerie dragon. They find it hilarious that mortals can get high off their breath, and will happily provide the breath attack itself with only gentle coaxing. Some faerie dragons make their home in drug dens, exchanging their breath for a luxurious lifestyle and the opportunity to ply their pranks upon the many citizens of a mortal city. Some particularly daring patrons will pay handsomely for a high 'straight from the source', taking the breath attack of the faerie dragonhead on and inhaling deeply. The high provided is incredibly intense, and as a result such services are usually only offered with the recipient strapped down on a specially constructed bench.</td>

This being can and will barter various intangible goods: knowledge, memories, skills. However, it only has access to such things as it could previously have acquired from another mummy powder user. Furthermore, it will not give any knowledge directly pertaining to its own nature or the nature of mummy powder. Finally, before making such a transaction, characters are filled with a sense of dread and the knowledge that the being would only have carried out such a bargain if it brought the day of its escape nearer.

<td dir="ltr">Droon: a potent, dull brown salve absorbed through one's pores, Droon greatly amplifies all sensations experienced by the body part, including proprioception. It can be an exhilarating or miserable experience, depending on how it's used- a drooned-up hand marvels at the softness of silk, but might seize up and develop rashes as the temperature fluctuates. The localized enhanced proprioception can be disorienting for new users as well, but the euphoric sensations it grants are well worth it. Droon is rumored to be the refined toxic extract of a particular tall cactus.</td>

<td dir="ltr">Ceruminal: a sparkling, faintly greenish wax originally sold as a decorative soap. A typical oral dose (about 12 grams) is enough to send an adult human of average weight into a pleasant mental fugue. They're incredibly disoriented during this time, often walking in elliptical loops, and when they eventually come down, all they remember is a sense of buoyancy and pleasant warmth. A rare few feel tiny sharp pounding at the top of their head, or dulled pain throughout their entire body. At lower doses, all it does is help clear sinuses. A dose in excess of twice the normal amount per body weight tends to result in worse experiences during the fugue- downing a whole block of Ceruminal soap often makes one feel like their muscles have sloughed off and were then shredded, all while the user can still feel their muscles.</td>

Once smoked the user gains plus 4 to strength checks while smoking but must make a DC 20 CON save or their brain and tongue swell giving them -5 to their INT score (Min 4) and an inability to speak clearly and a temper. The effects last while they smoke and 3D6 minutes after.</td>

<td dir="ltr">Watchroot: A simple, unprocessed root commonly used by goblins. You can chew over 3 hours, during which you gain advantage on perception checks, initiative checks, and can't be surprised. The juices can stain the teeth and lips with repeated use, leading to addicts being easily distinguishable thanks to their blood-red teeth and lips.</td>

<td dir="ltr">Dried Schmetterling Fish: The mummified remains of what once must have been a very colorful fish. Sardine sized, and extremely salty. The drying process moves this little guppy from incredibly poisonous to merely dangerously hallucinogenic. When consumed it allows the eater to see and hear into both the ethereal and astral planes, interact with creatures found there, and see invisible or shape-shifted creatures for what they truly are. It also makes the walls melt and the furniture start talking. You are considered under the effects of the “confusion” spell for the full hour these visions last.</td>

<td dir="ltr">Apius Acrimonium: The foot long stinger and venom sack of the monstrous Furori Vespartum (Rage Wasp) occasionally used by quack doctors and pit fighters. When stabbed into the body, an affected creature takes 1d4 piercing damage and 2d4 poison damage. If the target survives, it then flies into an unstoppable rage for 30 minute. This rage works as though the creature were a first level barbarian, except that they cannot choose to end it. Every turn they must make a DC15 Wis save or immediately attack the nearest living thing until it dies. Every round they manage to not attack something, the DC goes up by 1, resetting upon failure. When the rage subsides, the creature immediately takes two levels of exhaustion.</td>

<td dir="ltr">Dragon's Dandruff: A flaky amber salt traditionally used as seasoning by lizard-folk, with it's signature 'chilli-high' making any party memorable. This magical mineral is intensely spicy, with one unnamed individual unused to the taste describing it as akin to chewing on a hot coal. After the initial sizzle (1d2 radiant damage) a teaspoon of the salt gives the consumer a rushing sensation of joy, increasing Charisma by 1 for an hour. After the salt metabolizes, the soul feels overcome by adrenaline, increasing Strength, Stamina, and Dexterity by 2 for an hour, and they are compelled to do physical tasks. Afterwards, they suffer 1 level of exhaustion. All of these effects do no stack. Undead characters take 1d6 radiant damage for every teaspoon consumed.</td>

<td dir="ltr">Raybark: not actually made from bark at all, but by grounding up the thin strips of brightly colored fungus that grow on the northern side of raywood tree trunks. Raybark strongly amplifies 'strange' external senses when ingested or snorted- the ability to sense magnetic north, to tell when people are watching you (and where they are), to sense the coming of a storm, to read the health of a plant by the movements of its leaves in the wind, to see ultraviolet light, etc. The range of senses amplified and the intensity of amplification vary between users. However, the user's sense of their own body is greatly diminished while under the effects of Raybark, so they might trip over their own feet, swing their arms into their sides while running, or fail to properly clench their fists as their fingers miss each other. Produced and used by a convent of hippie-like pacifists who enjoy feeling more connected to the world around them.</td>

<td dir="ltr">Spiral: a flammable, forest-green liquid sold in small dropper jars, spiral is a fast-acting and addictive oral drug. A user's sinuses and sense of balance are thrown out of whack as the drug begins to take hold, making them very dizzy. It simultaneously acts to dull pain and mute powerful sensory stimuli, giving advantage on any rolls that are dependent on resisting pain, blinding light, massive sounds, terrible stenches, etc. The dizzying effect makes rolls to keep one's feet or dodge harder, however. Spiral can be slowly burnt to produce a relatively large volume of smoke that has a diluted version of its effects. The smoke seems to be lethal to most insects, and those that don't immediately die drift around aimlessly until they do.</td>

The effects last EXACTLY 5 minutes during this time the user must make a CON save DC 20 every time they knowingly attempt an chaotic act (if they don't know the law then they pass immediately) if they fail they lose the ability to lie and shout their intentions. In the past this drug has been used by lawful evil villains to catch or incriminate their enemies or by lawful good heroes for largely the same reasons.</td>
